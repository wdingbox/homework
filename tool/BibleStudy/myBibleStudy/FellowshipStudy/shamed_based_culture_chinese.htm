		<p>
			<br />
			<strong>I. Introduction</strong><br />
			There are many ways to know sins even though people do not consciously know harmatiology or the theological concept or definatiion of sin. Adam and Eve realized they committed sins against the Lord until they felt shamed, guilty, cold and fearful. The Jewish often recognized that they committed sins until they experienced the judgment and tribution. The ultimate results of sin is death. Different tribes use different ways to tackle sins in order to survive. This paper will examine and analysis how Chinese people who lost the relationship with the Lord use shame rather than the word of God to prevent sins.    

			
			 </p>

		<p>
			<strong>II. About Shame</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Definition of Shame</strong><br />
				<br />
				Merrian-Webster define shame as: a painful emotion caused by consciousness of guilt, shortcoming, or impropriety.<br />
				<br />
				Shame is usually associated with guilt and embarrassment. The boundaries between concepts of shame, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(emotion)" style="text-decoration-line: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;" title="Guilt (emotion)">guilt</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassment" style="text-decoration-line: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;" title="Embarrassment">embarrassment</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> cannot be clearly distinguished.</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> According to cultural anthropologist </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Benedict" style="text-decoration-line: none; color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;" title="Ruth Benedict">Ruth Benedict</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">, shame is a violation of cultural or social values while guilt feelings arise from violations of one&#39;s internal values.<br />
				<br />
				Comparied with embarrassment, some say that shame does not necessarily involve public humiliation while embarrassment does; that is, one can feel shame for an act known only to oneself but in order to be embarrassed one&#39;s actions must be revealed to others. In the field of ethics (moral psychology, in particular), however, there is debate as to whether or not shame is a heteronomous emotion, i.e. whether or not shame does involve recognition on the part of the ashamed that they have been judged negatively by others.</span><br />
				<br />
				Helen B. Lewis, a pioneer in recognizing the importance of shame to psychotherapy, argued that shame really represents an entire family of emotions. This family includes: humiliation, embarrassment, feelings of low self-esteem, belittlement, and stigmatization. Shame is often a central ingredient in experiences of being: alienated,inadequate, helpless, powerless, defenseless, weak, insecure, uncertain, shy, ineffectual, inferior, flawed, expos, unworthy, hurt, intimidated, defeated, rejected, dumped, rebuffed, stupid, bizarre, odd, peculiar, different.<br />
				<br />
				Shame manifests itself physically in a wide variety of forms. Face turned to red. The person may hide their eyes; lower their gaze; blush; bite their lips or tongue; present a forced smile; or fidget. Other responses may include annoyance, defensiveness, exaggeration or denial. Because the affect of shame often interferes with our ability to think, the individual may experience confusion, being at a loss for words, or a completely blank mind. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040820104726/http://www.columbiapsych.com/shame_miller.html">...</a><br />
				<br />
				Chronic shame may turn people to become introvet. When shame becomes extremely unbearable painful, it may lead to violence or suicide. Shame is also the tool used in prison system even though it is not humanate.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				Many people think that the opposite of shame is honor, which means good name or public esteem, reputation (Merrian-Webster). Honor can reduce shame but cannot be the antonym of shame. &#39;Insult&#39; can increase shame. The more appropriate opposite word for shame is &#39;pride&#39;, which means a feeling or deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one&#39;s own achievements, the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated, or from qualities or possessions that are widely admired. Both shame and pride are in the same category of psych emotion. Both of them are sinful feeling and nature of human beings. Honor and glory are positive words for righteousness.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				In a word, shame is a painful feeling of humiliation or distress caused by its relational public reflection due to his behaviors/actions.<br />
				 </li><br/>

			<li>

				<strong>Origin of Shame</strong><br />
				<br />
				The word of shame in Hebrew בּוּשׁ (boosh) first appeared in Gen 2:25. &quot;And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.&quot; It can be found that shame is an important component embedded inside of man when God created man and woman before their fall. The shame began to work after Adam and Eve failed to obey the God's food restriction--which cause them to take figure leaves to cover their naked body outside.<br />
				<br />
				From Gen 2:25, it also demonstrates that shame has close relationship with nakeness. The pupose of clothes for man is not to keep warm in winter but to cover the genital for glory. Human body began to be sensitive to the surrounding temperature after the sin. To keep warm is not original purpose of clothes. Clothes was originally used to fix the shame which was caused by rebelling against God.</li>
				<br/>
			<li>
				<strong>Functionality of Shame</strong><br />
				<br />
				Originally, shame can be considered as useful tool by God to reminder people to correct their sinful behaviors against God so that they can keep to follow the Mosaic law.<br />
				<br />
				Psa 119:6 Then I would not be put to shame when I consider all your commands.<br />
				Psa 119:31 I hold fast to your statutes, Lord; do not let me be put to shame.<br />
				Psa 119:46 I will speak of your statutes before kings and will not be put to shame<br />
				Psa 119:78 May the arrogant be put to shame for wronging me without cause; but I will meditate on your precepts.<br />
				Psa 119:80 May I wholeheartedly follow your decrees, that I may not be put to shame.<br />
				Psa 119:116 Sustain me, my God, according to your promise, and I will live; do not let my hopes be dashed.<br />
				Psa 109:28 While they curse, may you bless; may those who attack me be put to shame, but may your servant rejoice.<br />
				<br />
				<div>
					Rom 1:19</div>
				<div>
					since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.</div>
				<div>
					20 For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities&mdash;his eternal power and divine nature&mdash;have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.<br />
					<br />
					Abraham use the shame as tool for promise under God. circustamce is an example.</div>
				<br />
				<b>However, as human beings became more and more craft, they bagan to manipulate the shame for private usage. The first misuse of shame is recorded in </b>2Sam 10:4. Hanun made David King ashameful by cutting of his man&#39;s beard and garments in the middelt at the buttocks. Hanun pervert the meaning of shame from the result of rebelliance of God to the result of rebelliance of Hanun.<br />

				<div>

				<div>
					maintaining harmony in relationships is valued over maintaining behavior according</div>

					<br />
					For example, the Golden medal in Olympic Games, Academy Awards, Peace Nobel awards, etc are the human designed protocols for honoring. The prison, legitimate system are the punishment system for shame. All human beings more or less are driven under the shame/honor system.<br />

		<p><strong>III. Shame-based Chinese Culture.</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Chinese Shame<br /></p>

				Shame is embedded in man and reserved in many culture with various forms. Since the fall of Adam and Eve, shame accompanies with man all the times in the history and varies in all different cultures. Ruth Benedict was the first anthropologist to categorize Western culture as guilt-based and Eastern culture as shame-based. The typical expanding shame-based culture in the world for today is the Chinese culture.<br />


				
				<br />
				There are many Chinese charaters that express shame. The characters, 羞Xu, ashamed, 辱 (Ru,humiliate), 醜 (chou, ugly, shameful) can be found in Oracle Bones Inscriptions in 1600 BC. Charaters, 恥耻(chi,shame), 愧(kui, ashamed), 赧(Nan, red face in shame) can be found since bronze times in 800 BC. 腼腆(MianDian, shy) can be found in Zhuan during Pre-Qin times. As comparison, only a few characters are used to express guilt and they can be found after 600 BC, like character 疚 guilt, regret, remorse, chronical illness, 悔(hui, regret), 懊(ao, regret, remorse). Through these chinese characters analysis, it can be confirmed that the concept of shame plays more important roles in Chinese language and culture. It is recorded in Chinese classic book: Soldiers would be rather killed than insulted. (可殺而不可辱也, 禮記.儒行, 475--221 BC) In Chinese culture, the shame/honor is more important than death/life since ancient time.<br />
				<br />
				Today, the concept of shame permeates every aspect of Chinese life. [Wu p.153]<br />
				For example, in our daily life, instead of saying &quot;Excuse me.&quot; in English, Chinese people would say &quot;Bu Hao Yi Si.&quot;, which means &quot;It's embarrassed.&quot; When Chinese people say &quot;sorry&quot;, it also mixed with shame and guilt to himself. Chinese people seldomly talk about the sex in public, because they would feel shamed. When people say that Chinese culture is a shame-based culure, many would get nervous. &quot;Shame on you&quot; is one of most heart breaking insulting words for Chinese people.<br />
				 

<br />
			</li>
			<li>Chinese Face <br />
<br />
			Different from other Eatern shame-based cutlures, Chinese culture has developed its own speical form and concept from shame, which is called 'face', or in Chinese as YanMian顏面, MianZi 面子 or LianMian 脸面.<br />
			<br />
			The term YanMian(顏面) can be found in ShuoYuan (說苑 206 BC--9 AD), "to offend the face of lord." (敢犯主之顏面). 面子 (face) was first found in Chinese novel, The Golden Lotus 金瓶梅, during 1590--1610 AD. Lianmian 脸面 can be found widely in novel, Hong Lou Men 紅樓夢 (1780--1792 AD)
			<br />
			The character, 面Mian, 脸Lian, 顏Yan, are basically identical to denote face. 面 Mian can be found in Chinese oracle bones inscripture in 1600 BC. The word 顏(Yan) can be found in bronze scripture in 800 BC. It also has meaning "color". The character 脸 or 臉 (lian), which denotes cheek, can be widely found in Wei Jin times (魏晋时期, 220--420 AD)<br />
			<br />
			The relationship between shame/honor and face can first be found since pre-Qin times. XunZi JieBi(荀子 解蔽 475--221BC) mentioned that thick-face to bear dirty(厚顏而忍詬). ShiShu JiGongJie(史書 祭公解 475--221 BC) recoreded: thick-face bear ugly shame.(厚顏忍醜)<br />
			<br />
			Today, Chinese people, young and old, male and femal, are very sensitive and care about their face. Chinese people work hard to obtain two things in their life: one is money, another is face. Everyone knows what is money. But not everyone knows what is face. Lu Xun said &quot;It is fine to use &#39;face&#39; without thinking. but it is very confusing and troublesome if you want to investigate it.&quot; (但"面子"究竟是怎么一回事呢？不想还好，一想可就觉得胡涂。鲁迅文集 杂文集 且介亭杂文)
			<br />
			<br />
			It is not accurate to simply consider Chinese face as shame/honor. Li Yutang said that "it is impossible to translate Chinese face or make definition for it. It looks like honor but it is not." (脸面这个东西无法翻译，无法为之下定义。它像荣誉，又不像荣誉。) For example, in Western culture, there is no significant difference between to slap cheek and to slap buttock. But in Chinese culture, to slap cheek is great insulting and more than the punishment to slap butt. In Chinese culture, a person who was laid off in a company not only means that he lose the job but also lost imply that he lost face. However, Chinese people feel satisfied to steal intelectual property. LuXun said that "steal and take" are same thing in Chinese culture. Chinese people would feel faceless for not paying gratidue tips but not stealing tarrif or tax. To better understand Chinese face, it is necessary to list its usage first.<br />

		</li>
		<li>Chinese Shame-based Culture Analysis<br />
			<!--- face, shame -->
			(1) shame on face <br/>
			From above usage, it can be found that the concept of Chinese face is closely associated with shame. The connection between face and shame in China has its psychological and biological reasons. When a person is ashamed, his blood will go up to fill in his face. Then his face will turn red and swell and become ugly, and he can feel hot on his face like fever (脸上发烧). To react the shame, most people will try to avoid eye contact. Some people will use hands to cover his face. Some Chinese people describes that they want to hide themselves by finding a hole on earth. 
			The chronic mild shame could lead to the introvert. The servere shame may casue people to seek monk or suicide. Chinese shame is one of the strongest psychological reactions reserved in the world. Chinese face can be considered as the living psychological fossil for biblical research. It allow us, especially those in guilt-based culture, to better understand the psychological feeling of Adam and Eve after eating the forbiden fruit. <br /><br />

			<!---face, shame, human relationship --->
			(2) shame through relationship<br/>
			But Chinese shame has differences as compared with the biblical shame. Chinese shame is a kind of the psychological reflection of wordly glory, honor, reputation merely in its community or society. Biblical shame is the reflection for self, others and God (Gen 3:8). Chinese shame is merely related to social relationship (Guanxi) without concept of God at all. The more complicated its social relationship will be, the stronger the Chinese shame reaction will produce.  
			Chinese shame will disappear if he is left alone. Whereas the biblical shame has no place to hide and appears the same all the time. <br />The essense of relationship is to revenge--if i goto hell, i want all go to hell. <br />

			(3) shame in history <br/>

			The internal meaning of Chinese shame always changes according to different dynasty and political environment. For exampe, during the Culture Revolutionary period (1966-1976), those who were born from poverty were considered as glory and pride. So those who were rich had no face in street. But today, those who are poor feel ashameful. Such kind of changes is one of reasons to make it difficult to define the capricous Chinese face. Whereas the meaning of the original biblical shame will never change, even human beings has adaptive capability, the psychological inner pain of shame can never been removed no matter how human being to pervert shame, unless it is coveved by the Blood of Lamb of God.    <br /><br />

			<!-----face, shame, righteousness   -->
			(4) shame for righteousness<br/>

			Chinese shame not only is closely assoicated with human relationship, but also has individable connection to Chinese righteousnes. MenZi defined righteousness in terms of psychological feeling of shame: "the heart with shame for wicked is righteousness." (羞惡之心,義也). It means that those who can feel ashameful for sin are righteous. If a person has no shame for wicked, he is evil. The rightecousness is defined by shame, shame can be presented on face. It is this logic that binds face and righteousness together to form this special Chinese culture--those who have no face are evil, face represent the glory.  <br /><br />

			The connection between face and righteousness is theologically correct in that both the righteousness and glory coexist to present the different properties of God. If one of properties is lost, all will be lost. The initial face of man has image of God along with properties of God. Man who has no righteousness has no glory. Likewise, no glory, no righteousness. The righteousness and glory are undividable in theology. <br /><br />

			<!-----face, shame, righteousness, life   -->
			(5) shame for glory <br/>
			Among all Chinese moral codes, including rightenouness, loyalty, honesty, charity, benevolence, compassion, altruism, dignity, holiness, etc. Chinese rightenouness is the only one that is considered more important than life/death. MenZi said that he "would rather choose rightenouness than live."(舍生而取義). "To die with rightenouness is better than to live without rightenouness." (無義而生，不如有義而死, 說苑 劉向 206 BC--9 AD). "rightenousness is heavier than body." (義重於身也, 說苑 劉向 206 BC--9 AD). To emphasize on rightenousness over life is one of possible reasons that Chinese culture choose shame rather than guilt to connect to righteousness. Since guilt belongs to inner personal life. Shame is social relational. "Do not feel guilt for rightenouness." (不為義疚, 春秋左傳, 468--300 BC). This significantly differentiates the Chinese shame-based culture to the Western guilt-based culture. Guilt causes people to find logic reasons for excuses. Whereas shame is to maintain harmony relationship to cover faults. The differentiation is not an issue--both cultures are lying culture. The fatal problem for Chinese is that in all Chinese docuemtns in whole history, no accurate definition of rightenouness can be found.  <br /><br />






				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />

				The face culture is hell culture.  
				To Chinese chulture, to goto hell is not fearful but shameful. 
				"If I goto hell, i want my friends and family goto hell too. If everyone goto to hell I do not feel shameful."
				<br />



			Human ethnic is not determined by his unchangable skin color or changable nationality, but by his characteristics of his culture he inherits. Just like the native languages changes is hard for people, ethnic change is also very hard becase it combines with both biological hardware and worlview software.  

			It is hard to determine which culture is biblical good or not. But it is clear that Western culture in history have produced many Christians. Chinese culture, without Western influence, has not produced any Christian yet in history. This is evidence any culture can be isolated but need other cultures to survive. 


			Chinese shame is a perversion of biblical shame.<br />

			Chinese face can be used as a tool to effectively make large amount of Christian like people. But its side-effect is that its internal heart may never ever connect to Jesus--they are Christian-like but not Christ-like.  
			<br />



	
			<br />
		

		

			To maintain the face is to maintain such network relationship. Without such relationship, people can hardly get job and live. <br />
			<br /> 





			When Chinese relationship could not maintain anymore, there will first have a invisilbe face war before the millitary war. The face war usually have good title called the "rightenousness" or "justice".  



			<br />
			<br />
			It is a mixture of many elements and concepts of the culture, including shame, honor, reputation, social status, social relationship, glory, moral, rightenousness and truth, etc. At the same time, the Chinese face have also unique unified identity. Essentially the chinese face is the image of a person, which is self &quot;me&quot;. To struggle to live is to struggle to maintain face. To earn a degree is to add glory to face, to be polite is to maintain face, to do good deed is to add reputation on face, and so on. Du Yue Shen once said, &quot;Two noodle (faces) are most difficult to eat. The face in public affair and the face in private relationship.&quot; Chinese people live by face rather than faith.<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			Chinese people work hard to obtain two things in their life: one is face, another is money. When face and money became exlusive, most Chinese would usually choose face. Menzi(340--250 BC) said: &quot;Life is what I want, righteousness is also what i want. But if they are exclusive, I prefer righteouness to life.&quot; (生,亦我所欲也;義,亦我所欲也,二者不可得兼,舍生而取義者也). In chinese culture, face represents rightenousness. To lose face means to lost the righteousness which is more important than biological life. It is natural today that many Chinese people would rather want face than die. (want face to death. 死要面子). Those who lost his face in China will be denounced as the one &quot;without face.&quot; and has no room to live. Chinese people clear understand that the Chinese relationship, which is part of face, is actually above the constitution and laws in China.<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />

			Each Chinese face is essentially the selfish for "me". The father the face is liar. LuXun said, "what the so-called righteous and moral is actually the man-eating-man." Chinese people were products of the Chinese cultures, they do't know their culture, but they love their mother culture and they defend their culture, die for it for their void face. 

			"the harmony relstaionship" is essentially the "comparative relationship." which is against biblical "unconditional divine love relationship."

			Behind the face, the real one is "me"--selfish. "Me" can be any kinds of faiths, ideologies and worldviews, including Daoism, Buddhism, or even Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, Induism, Marxism, etc. Chinese face culture can absorb any faith, worldview, as long as they work for face--to make face unashameful, handsome, polite, humble, lovely, righteous, dignant in public appearance.  


			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Chinese Shame-based Culture Contextualization</strong><br />
				Culture revolution.<br />
				At one hand, Chinese people are the products of the face culture which is derived from the shame-based culture. Chinese culture basically was a face driven culture--all people was limited inside of the network of faces. On the other hand, Chinese people are the maintainer and developer of face culture. Following elements are keys to maintain the face culture.<br />
				<br />
				1) Gossip<br />
				Gossip and background judgment are common among Chinese people. Each idividual&#39;s face is formed through their gossip and judgement. Gossip is one of the primary powers to associate people together. People know each other through gossip. Through gossip, people aquare living skill and knowledge. It is also through gossip that people get comfort in social peer pressure. People grew up and learn to be a man among the gossips. Chinese people are gossip people--they are not good at public speaking but goot at private talk. Gossip is one of factors to contribute the multiple local dialects in China.<br />
				<br />
				2) Honor/Shame (HS) language<br />
				Chinese language is one of few langueages in the world that has no tense, no number, no gender. But Chinese language is a strong Honor/Shame (HS) language. Those who have face will be praised, honored or described with possitive words, and also will be admired by little or no face. Those who have no face live in bottom of society, will be maltreated and will be looked down upon and mocked with negative words. It is easy to use Chinese language to produce the shameful or honorable words or title. Being associated with the political power, the Chinese HS gossip language became the natural resource for the the protocols of shame and honor. Chinese culture do no need consitution or law, even it has, it is useless. The face network are powerful enough to maintain the stability of society and move the society on following its worldview and faith.<br />
				<br />
				From above analysis, it can be found that Chinese shame-based culture contain three critical elements: Chinese face, Chinese gossip and Chinese HS language. These three elements contribute and dependent on each others and form one of the hardest stronghold in the world for missionary to break into it.<br />
				Among three elements of the Chinese shame-based culture, the Chinese gossip is the primary target for missionary to work on.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				Complicating matters, Confucian teachings say that you're supposed to treat people differently depending your relative statuses.<br />
				<br />
				Similarly, the Chinese concept of the "truth" is not black or white either. The emphasis is less on always telling the objective "truth," and more about what the situation and relationship calls for.<br />

				"True shame cultures rely on external sanctions for good behavior, not, as true guilt cultures do, on an internalized conviction of sin. &hellip; [Shame] requires an audience or at least a man's fantasy of an audience. Guilt does not."<br />
				Chinese faceism and Jewish ritualism are essentially the same thing.</li>

				The second target that missionary need to work on is the face-center culture. face-center is self-center. Deny youself.<br />

				Chinese culture is mixted with all different schools. became complicated. It is prooof not holy culture.<br />
				<br />
				The Scripture can not only be translated into different languages, but also be contextualized into various cultures. The different languages and various cultures help to make more human beings in all ethnics and all nations as one unit to understand universal eternal messages of the Gospels deeper and more accurately. For example, the meaning of a verse can be more explicit if compared with multiple different versions of the Bible. Besides, a specific culture can be hardly understood without comparison of others. For example, without Western guilt-based culture, Chinese shame-based face culture is inscrutable. Through these observation, it could also help us to better understand the prophetic christorical purposes why at Babel city God confused its original one language and common speech and scattered them there over the face of the whole earth. (Gen 11:1-9)<br />

				for the product of shame-based culture but more than the protocols of shame and honor.<br />
				Since their faces represents their fame and reputaion. Those who lost face means to be ashameful. To earn credits or honor means to add glorious light on his face. Chinese people work hard to obtain two things in their life: one is face, another is money.<br />

				For Chinese people, to struggle to live is to struggle to maintain the face.<br />

				<br />
				But it is clear that in the Bible the face can be used to represent the image of God. For example, &quot;I saw God face to face,&quot; (Gen 32:30) &quot;To see your face is like seeking the face of God (Gen 33:10) To maintain the face of man and to maintain the glory of God has identical theological significance. However, Chinese poeple did not understand that no matter how hard to work to maintain their face, it is impossible to keep it as glory as its image that God origically created. Rom () So to glory each other and to maintain their superfacially harmony relationship is the only way to bring false comfort for their shame.<br />
