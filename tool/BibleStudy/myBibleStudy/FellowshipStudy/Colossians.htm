			1:21:<br />
			Unbelief is to alienate from God.<br />
			Unbelief is the enemy of God. evil mind+ evil behavior.&nbsp;<br />
			<br />
			Don&#39;t be attracted from Gospel.&nbsp;<br />
			1) pleasing ears:&nbsp;&nbsp;Retreat, Summer Camp, etc are good. But do not reply on them. Buddhism voice.<br />
			2) pleasing eyes: Multimedia, video, autdio. Music etc.&nbsp;<br />
			3) pleasing mind:<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; (1) news;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; (2) man-made Mystery: Jesus is mystery. There is no any mystery anymore in the world. Don&#39;t be cheaped by the world, UFO, Alien man, Bamuda Triangle, Egypt Paramond, Mars, etc.<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; (3) &quot;Disclosure&quot; is endless, until the end of Day.&nbsp;There is always mystery in&nbsp; Disclosure. The richness is endless. The disclosure is just the direction of salvation. not itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
			4) pleasing body: Do not rely on personal success. (family, career, finance, peaceul life, comfort enrionment, etc. )<br />
			5) pleasing heart: Do not rely on personal relationship. But on the Gospels.&nbsp;<br />

			<ol>
				<li>a bad phylosophy: God create angel, angel create another angel, and so on. 
				One of them is Jesus, Jesus created the world. The physical world is evil. 
			Reduce the level of Jesus (similar to JW)</li>

				<li>mysticism: to get to God, you had to pay worship to an angel. 
				he could get your msg back to God </li>

				
				
				<li>Legalism:the physical world is evil. put ourself under legalistic control to get ourselves to get out flesh to behave and so they brought in parts of the Mosaic law to do this. </li>

				<li>asceticism: the physical world is bad you have to deny your body basic needs
				such as food, sex like that. </li>

			</ol>

			Don't go under some human philosophy but go back to Christ. 
			you have everything you need in him.
