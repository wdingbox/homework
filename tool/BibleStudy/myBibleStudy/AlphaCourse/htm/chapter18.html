						<p>
							Once the self-consciousness(自我意识) is formed, it&#39;s congenital to ask &quot;where did i come from?&quot;, then &quot;where did man come from?&quot;, &quot;where did the universe come from?&quot;</p>
						<p>
							Ontology 本体论 : 研究存在的問題, where, how about being.<br />
							Metaphysics 形上學: 是指研究存在和事物本质的学问, why, purpose, essense.</p>
						<p>
							Atheism:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Gnosticism 可知論: the philosophical doctrine that everything about the universe is knowable by Using human effort: scientific logic reasoning;<br />
								- Darwin Evolutions: man from ape.<br />
								- Marxism: labor theory.</li>
							<li>
								Agnosticism 不可知論: Impossible to know the universe&nbsp;(thru Mediation,logic,etc)<br />
								<a href="https://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/297.htm">Buddhism Answer</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html">Sutta</a>&nbsp;The Poisoned Arrow Parable)&nbsp;<br />
								<a>One day a man called Malunkyaputta approached the&nbsp;</a><strong>Gautama Buddha&nbsp;</strong><a>and demanded him to explain the origin of the Universe, life to him. He even threatened to cease to be His follow if the Buddha&#39;s answer was not satisfactory. The Buddha calmly retorted.&nbsp;</a>
								<ol>
									<li>
										it was of no consequence to Him whether or not Malunkyaputta followed Him, because the Truth did not need anyone&#39;s support.</li>
									<li>
										<a>Gaining knowledge about such matters was a waste of time because a man&#39;s task was to liberate himself from the present, not the past or the future.&nbsp;</a></li>
									<li>
										He never promised to reveal ultimate metaphysical truths.</li>
									<li>
										<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Poisoned_Arrow">Parable of the Poisoned Arrow</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s just as if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poison. His friends &amp; companions, kinsmen &amp; relatives would provide him with a surgeon, and the man would say, &#39;I won&#39;t have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble warrior, a priest, a merchant, or a worker.&#39; He would say, &#39;I won&#39;t have this arrow removed until I know the given name &amp; clan name of the man who wounded me... until I know whether he was tall, medium, or short... until I know whether he was dark, ruddy-brown, or golden-colored... until I know his home village, town, or city... until I know whether the bow with which I was wounded was a long bow or a crossbow... until I know whether the bowstring with which I was wounded was fiber, bamboo threads, sinew, hemp, or bark... until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was wild or cultivated... until I know whether the feathers of the shaft with which I was wounded were those of a vulture, a stork, a hawk, a peacock, or another bird... until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was bound with the sinew of an ox, a water buffalo, a langur, or a monkey.&#39; He would say, &#39;I won&#39;t have this arrow removed until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow, a curved arrow, a barbed, a calf-toothed, or an oleander arrow.&#39; The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to him.</li>
								</ol>
								<a>Malunkyaputta was delighted of such teaching.&nbsp;</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Chrsitanity: depend on&nbsp;God&#39;s revelation.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Ontology/metaphysics is important for man:origin determine destiny, truth, faith.</li>
							<li>
								Ontology/metaphysics comes from God, was embeded in man not animals.&nbsp;</li>
							<li>
								Those who did not know the origin are like miserable orphans.&nbsp;</li>
							<li>
								for parents: it&#39;s embarroassing for children.</li>
							<li>
								for engineers: it&#39;s impossible for the robot made. (Stepford&#39;s wives)</li>
							<li>
								for atheism, it is&nbsp;illogical, strange, hard to understand(being created).</li>
							<li>
								The process to know man is the one to know God.&nbsp;</li>
