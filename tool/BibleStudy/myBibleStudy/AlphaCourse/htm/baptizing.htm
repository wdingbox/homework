				<strong>Baptism</strong></center>
			<strong>1. Forms of Baptism</strong>: with water, HolySpirit and fire.(Mat 3:11)<br />
			Mat 3:11&nbsp;<br />
			I baptize you with[in] water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with[in] the Holy Spirit and fire.我是用水給你們施洗,叫你們悔改.但那在我以後來的,能力比我更大, 我就是給 他提鞋也不配.他要用聖靈與火給你們施洗.<br />
			<br />
			<div>
				<strong>2. Origin of Baptism</strong></div>
			<div>
				Mat 21:25</div>
			<div>
				John&rsquo;s baptism&mdash;where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?&rdquo;&nbsp; They discussed it among themselves and said, &ldquo;If we say, &lsquo;From heaven,&rsquo; he will ask, &lsquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you believe him?&rsquo;約翰的洗禮是從那裡來的?是從天上來的?是從人間來的呢?他們 彼此商議說:我們若說從天上來,他必對我們說:這樣,你們為甚麼不信他呢? (OT non)</div>

				Part of Priesthood Ritual:</div>
			<div>
				Exodus 29:4 Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water 要使亞倫和他兒子到會幕門口來,<u><strong><em>用水洗身</em></strong></u>.<br />
				<br />
				Part of Mosaic Law: (Cleanse after touch corpse,&nbsp;leper, women,etc)&nbsp;<br />
				Leviticus 22:6 The one who touches any such thing will be unclean till evening. He must not eat any of the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water. 摸了這些人,物的,必不潔淨到晚上;若不<u><strong><em>用水洗身</em></strong></u>,就不可吃聖物.<br />
				<br />
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essenes">Essenes</a> (200BC--100AD) Purification Ritual (Hidden).&nbsp;<br />
				Ritual purification was a common practice among the peoples of Judea during this period and was thus not specific to the Essenes. Ritual baths are found near many Synagogues of the period. Purity and cleanliness was considered so important to the Essenes that they would refrain from defecation on the Sabbath.&nbsp;<br />

					1 Peter 3:20-21&nbsp;<br />
					20&nbsp;to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, 21 and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also&mdash;not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God.[a] It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 20就是那從前在挪亞預備方舟、神容忍等待的時候，不信從的人。當時進入方舟，藉著水得救的不多，只有八個人。&nbsp;21&nbsp;<u>這水所表明的洗禮</u>&nbsp;，現在藉著耶穌基督復活也拯救你們；這洗禮本不在乎除掉肉體的污穢，只求在神面前有無虧的良心。<br />

			<strong>3. Reasons (Purposes) for Baptism</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
			(1) John 1:31&nbsp; I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.&rdquo;我先前不認識他,如今我來用水施洗,為要叫他顯明給以色列人 。(this is a new ritual long with Jesus)<br />
			(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Peter 3:21&nbsp;<br />
			(3)&nbsp; a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wordcenter.org/Baptism/essence.htm">must</a>&nbsp;if to baptize others (Mat28:19)<br />
			<br />
			<strong>4. Did Jesus baptize?</strong><br />
			Answer: John 3:22<br />
			這事以後,耶穌和門徒到了猶太地,在那裡居住,施 洗.&nbsp;<br />
			After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. (no name &amp; method)<br />
			<br />
			The Bible does not record anyone being baptized by Jesus. John 4:1&ndash;2 records, &ldquo;Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John&mdash;although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples&rdquo; (emphasis added: John 4:1&ndash;2 其實不是耶穌親自施 洗,乃是他的門徒施洗) This does not necessarily mean that Jesus never baptized anyone Himself. But during the specific timeframe surrounding John 4:1&ndash;2, Jesus did not baptize.<br />
			<br />
			Opening the possibility that Jesus did baptize is Matthew 3:14, in which John the Baptist says to Jesus, &ldquo;I need to be baptized by you.&rdquo;Matthew 3:14 約翰想要攔住他,說:我當受你的洗,你反倒上我這裡來麼 Also, in Matthew 3:11 John the Baptist, speaking about Jesus, declares, &ldquo;I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&rdquo; But neither of these verses is conclusive about whether or not Jesus baptized. Matthew 3:11 is not referring to water baptism. Neither Matthew 3:11 or 3:14 specifically say that Jesus Himself baptized anyone.<br />
			<br />
			The question of whether Jesus baptized anyone cannot be definitively answered. Based on John 4:1&ndash;2, it seems unlikely that Jesus Himself baptized. Why would Jesus not personally baptize anyone?<br />
			(1) The Bible does not say directly. A plausible explanation for why Jesus may not have baptized anyone is that Jesus did not want anyone thinking themselves superior to other believers based on who had baptized them. Someone baptized by Jesus would be tempted to broadcast the fact and feel a little smug around those who were only baptized by, say, Thomas or Thaddaeus. Such proud sectarianism is human nature. The apostle Paul rebukes those who divided over being baptized by Apollos versus being baptized by Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:12&ndash;15.<br />
