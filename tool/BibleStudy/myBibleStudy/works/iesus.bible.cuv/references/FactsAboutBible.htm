			The Bible has so many amazing facts. Here is a list of ten of them.</div>
		<h2>
			1 &ndash; The Writing of the Bible</h2>
		<div>
			The Bible was written over a 1600 year period by approximately 40 men. The time of the writing was from 1500 BC to AD 100.</div>

		<h2>

		<div>

		<h2>
			5 &ndash; The Bible Claims to be God&rsquo;s Word</h2>
		<div>
			There are many books written about and by various religions. But the Bible is the only one which claims to be the actual words of God. Those who believe the Bible also believe that God inspired various people through the years to write down His actual words for mankind. The Bible says more than 3,000 times &ldquo;thus saith the Lord.&rdquo; It claims that the words which follow are quotes from God.</div>
		<h2>
			6 &ndash; The Bible is Historically Accurate</h2>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			There were several secular historians who wrote about the events of the New Testament at the same time the Bible was being written. Josephus is the most well-known of them. He was a Jewish historian. Tacitus was a Roman historian who would have no benefit from not telling the truth. Both these men, as well as others, can be used to back up the historical accuracy of the Bible.</div>
		<div>
			There are historical discoveries regularly coming to light that continue to support the accuracy of the Bible. Merrill Unger, who compiled a Bible dictionary wrote, &ldquo;Old Testament archeology has rediscovered whole nations, resurrected important peoples, and in a most astonishing manner filled in historical gaps, adding immeasurably to the knowledge of Biblical backgrounds.&rdquo;</div>
		<h2>
			7 &ndash; The Business of the Bible</h2>
		<div>
			There are more than 168,000 Bibles either sold or given away per day in the United States according to the Gideons, Wycliffe International and the International Bible Societies.</div>

		<div>
			The Bible has been translated into more than 1,200 languages.</div>
		<h2>
			8 &ndash; The Bible Never Contradicts Itself</h2>
		<div>
			There are no contradictions in the Bible. Various people claim to find contradictions but they have to take verses out of context to do so. When looking at the Bible as a whole and understanding its teachings there are no contradictions. This is amazing when one considers that the Bible was written over such a long period of time.</div>

			10 &ndash; The Writers of the Bible</h2>
		<div>

		<div>
			The Bible attributes more than 3,000 proverbs to King Solomon. These are not all written in the book of Proverbs. However, most of that book is said to be the proverbs of Solomon.</div>
