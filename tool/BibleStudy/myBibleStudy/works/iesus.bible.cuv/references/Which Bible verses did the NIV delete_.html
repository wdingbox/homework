<center><font size="+3">Which Bible verses did<br> the NIV delete?</font></center>
<p></p><blockquote>Several readers have asked me this question so I thought it worthwhile to include my response here. Please note that these are only WHOLE verses that the NIV deletes. This list does not include the many <i>words and phrases</i> that were completely deleted from the NIV--it deletes over 64,000 words including words like mercyseat, Jehovah, and Godhead. It removes meaningful, well-known Bible words like Calvary, Lucifer, new testament, regeneration, etc. Most of the modern Bibles line up very closely with the NIV--and so does the New World Translation--the Bible of the Jehovah's Witnesses which predates the NIV!
<p><img src="./Which Bible verses did the NIV delete__files/updated.gif" height="12" width="60" alt="updated">When you read below where I say that a verse is COMPLETELY deleted, I mean clean/bald-headed/gone/vanished deleted. For instance, if you search for Acts 8:37 in the NIV you will read,
</p><blockquote><b>36</b>As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?"
<br><b>38</b>And he ordered the chariot to stop. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.</blockquote>
<p>Verse 37 is CLEAN, BALD-HEADED, GONE, VANISHED, MY FRIENDS (and it is a powerful verse)! Some foolish people have written me saying, "But it says something in the footnotes." I have three responses. (1) When you are reading your Bible do you look at the footnotes after every verse? Do you say "I am reading verse 3 so let me look below and see if something in verse 3 is missing."? Even if you did do that (which you don't) the footnotes say that the "best manuscripts" don't have the verse--will you then agree with them that the verse doesn't belong? If not, then why are you reading an NIV? [Note: <a href="http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/sinaiticus.htm">Not everyone believes that those "older" manuscripts are authentic</a>.] (2) Not all the word deletions are found in the footnotes of the NIV so don't think for a second that they are letting you know all the changes they made. (3) The next logical step will be for the NIV to omit the footnotes and just reorder everthing. In the example above verse 38 would become verse 37 so it wouldn't look funny. Look at the <a href="http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/phillips.htm">J.B. Phillips</a> translation--that heretick didn't number the individual verses so you don't know what you're missing. It's paragraph style. The NIV may go that way too. They are desensitizing you to the changing of the very words of God. In summary, they'll either renumber or go to that paragraph format. <br><i><img src="./Which Bible verses did the NIV delete__files/updated.gif" height="12" width="60" alt="updated"> Wait a minute, hold the presses! I got the following from Bill W. one of our dear readers:
</i></p><blockquote><i> "I was in the Christian Book store today. I saw some
thing that shocked me. I look through the Bibles often. I looked at the
CHILDREN'S NIV. I looked up the missing verses and there was something I
could not believe. I looked up Matt 17:21 and of course it is missing
BUT in this Children's Bible it was typed out like this 20/21 and the
21st verse was still missing. They make you think that you read the 21st
verse but it still is just the 20th verse! Can you believe it???!!! If
you want to look for yourself find the CHILDREN'S NIrV BIBLE, and see
for yourself. I did look in the other NIV's to see if they did the same
thing. They DID NOT do that, BUT how long before they do?????!" </i></blockquote><i>
</i><p><i>They are already sneaking the deletions into the children's Bibles! This is the second time that I've heard of those foxes pulling one over on little helpless children. The other thing I've seen them do is retranslate the kids' and prisoners' Bibles to make them gender neutral. Of course those foxes didn't market them that way, they just snuck in the gender inclusivity. See this <a href="http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/niv.htm">article</a> for details. </i>
</p><p><i><img src="./Which Bible verses did the NIV delete__files/updated.gif" height="12" width="60" alt="updated">Another update! I just opened the JW "Bible", the <i>New World Translation</i> (1961 ed.), and looked up all the verses that the NIV completely deletes. THE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS BIBLE DELETES THE EXACT SAME ONES!!!! I mean <b><u>ALL</u></b> of them! <b>The only difference between the NIV and the New World Translation deletions is that the JW Bible does not include any footnotes!</b> Isn't that what I said above, that the NIV would eventually delete the footnotes? To learn more about the Jehovah's Witnesses and their damnable doctrines go to our article on <a href="http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/cults.htm">cults</a>.
</i>
</p><p>Our illiterate, lazy culture has spilled over to many professing Christians who have embraced the ways of the sluggard (and their want shall come upon them as an armed man). They are willing to read a Satanic "Bible" version missing what God says so they can be lazy and not do their due diligence. Your modern Bible perversion was written by men using <a href="http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/howtrans.htm">dynamic equivalence</a>. In other words, they are telling you their interpretation and their doctrine--NOT what the manuscripts really say. Don't believe me? Look at the article on the NIV using <a href="http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/niv.htm">gender inclusive language</a>. Gender inclusivity wasn't in the "originals"--it is a modern, feminist concept born of REBELLION.
</p><p>A number of brothers and sisters, after examining the facts, have said, "I'm getting a King James!" Many have shared what a blessing the King James Bible has been to them and their spiritual life. The King James isn't hard. I've seen one and two year olds quoting it and I am not exaggerating. I've taught it to people who cannot read and to children whose second language is English. I actually find the modern Bibles <a href="http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/archaic.htm">more difficult</a> to read than the King James.
</p><p>If you read a modern Bible, don't let your pride get in the way of really looking at this information. Some people get hostile because I'm sharing these facts. Look up the verses and see that what you call the Bible is
not the Bible. Get a real Bible. The King James conformable to the edition of 1611--NOT the New King James or the KJ21, etc. they are not King James Bibles.

NIV--whether in the text or footnotes...<b>over 40 IN ALL!!!</b>
</p><p></p><p><b>Matthew 12:47 </b>-- removed in the footnotes<br>
</p><p><b>Matthew 17:21 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting." <br>
</p><p><b>Matthew 18:11 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost." <br>

houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the
greater damnation." <br>
</p><p><b>Mark 7:16 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear." <br>

</p><p><b>Mark 9:46 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." <br>
</p><p><b>Mark 11:26 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven
forgive your trespasses." <br>
</p><p><b>Mark 15:28 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with
the transgressors." <br>
</p><p><b>Mark 16:9-20 (all 12 verses) </b>-- There is a line separating the last 12 verses of Mark from the main text. Right under the line it says: [The two most reliable early manuscripts do not have Mark 16:9-20] (NIV, 1978 ed.) The Jehovah's Witness "Bible" also places the last 12 verses of Mark as an appendix of sorts.<br>
</p><p><b>Luke 17:36 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other
left." <br>
</p><p><b>Luke 22:44 </b>-- removed in the footnotes<br>
</p><p><b>Luke 22:43 </b>-- removed in the footnotes<br>
</p><p><b>Luke 23:17 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)" <br>
</p><p><b>John 5:4 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the
water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made
whole of whatsoever disease he had." <br>
</p><p><b>John 7:53-8:11 </b>-- removed in the footnotes<br>
</p><p><b>Acts 8:37 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. It's deletion makes one think that people can be baptized and saved without believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. Sounds Catholic. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And
he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." <br>
</p><p><b>Acts 15:34 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still." <br>
</p><p><b>Acts 24:7 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took
him away out of our hands," <br>
</p><p><b>Acts 28:29 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great
reasoning among themselves." <br>
</p><p><b>Romans 16:24 </b>-- COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. What are you NIV readers missing?<br> "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen." <br>
</p><p><b>I John 5:7 </b>-- Vitally important phrase COMPLETELY removed [also deleted from the Jehovah's Witness "Bible"]. In the NIV it says,
</p><blockquote> "For there are three that testify:" </blockquote>
<p>Compare the NIV reading with the following Jehovah's Witness reading--
</p><blockquote>"For there are three witness bearers,"</blockquote>
<p> What are you NIV readers missing? What does the real Bible say?
</p><blockquote> "For there are three that bear record in heaven, <u>the Father, the Word, and
the Holy Ghost: and these three are one</u>." </blockquote>
<p> This is one of the GREATEST verses testifying of the trinity. The Jehovah's Witnesses leave it out. They do not believe in the trinity and they do not believe that Jesus is God. Why does the NIV leave it out...? Whole books have been written on the manuscript evidence that supports inclusion of this verse in the Bible. Reader, do you believe in the triunity of God? If so, then this deletion should offend you. People are wresting and perverting the scriptures to their own destruction.

</p><blockquote><b>There is only one Authorized Version of the Bible; there shall be no other.</b> The Revised Standard Version is not the Authorized Version. The American Standard Version is not the Authorized Version. They are both unauthorized versions and are not admitted nor accepted amongst those that receive the Authorized Version as the authorized version of the Bible (which is what it is). <u><b>By definition, every Bible version that is not the Authorized Version is an unauthorized version and therefore rejected (whether there be hundreds, thousands, or multiplied millions (as in billions, trillions, or more) of these productions on the market).</b></u>

<p><b>No changes to the Authorized Version are admitted on any wise. By definition, any Bible version that is not the Authorized Version is an unauthorized version.</b> No one with a modicum (a little bit, a small quantity) of sense would boldly walk into a nation, scramble around its laws and constitution (and adding and subtracting therefrom), and then say that their vandalism and impudent proclamations are based on "the originals" and that the centuries-old statutes that the people of the kingdom have been thriving off of are unreliable. That would shake a kingdom at its foundation should its citizens be simple enough to listen to such person, but the kingdom of God is governed by the King of kings and Lord of lords that revealeth secrets and maketh known what his people need to know; his people know his voice and know not the voice of strangers--his people make whatever adjustments they need to make for they believe and obey the truth. They flee from strangers and will continue to do so. When the Lord Jesus comes back, his church will be waiting for him. The word of God will stand no matter what impious gainsayers may do.
</p><blockquote><b>GAINSAYER,</b> n. (those who contradict or deny what is alleged; opposers, ref. Webster's 1828).</blockquote>
<p>The enemy is very interested in the word of God, for if he can wrest it from the people, the people will be deceived, sick, weakly, dependent on the "experts," unrighteous, sinful, weak (and weakening), and of no threat to his kingdom. How many church people have gone to hell and how many will go...
</p><p>The Authorized Version is the touchstone whereby men (and their inventions) and spirits are tried. If any man or spirit speak not according to the authorized version of God's word, it is because there is no light in them. Now, in the midst of the deep deception overtaking the earth, is the time for splitting hairs and proving all things (doctrines, laws, etc.) by comparing them to the word of God, the Authorized Version.</p></blockquote>

</p><p><b>I said to him</b>, That "provisional" statement is, at best, casting doubt
on the word of
God and at worst deleting the information in the footnotes. You say that the NIV
says, the <u>MOST RELIABLE</u> manuscripts don't have it. That is as good as saying, "If you accept this rendering you are accepting an inferior, unreliable manuscript." What they DON'T tell you is that those same "reliable" manuscripts DON'T EVEN INCLUDE THE WHOLE BOOK OF REVELATION!!! If the manuscript is so reliable, then why didn't they take out the WHOLE book of Revelation? Mmm? Selective deletion? Why not be true to what they say are the <i>earliest and most reliable</i> manuscripts? I have no respect for this.
</p><p>As I receive further information, I will upate this page. This is a fight for the word of God, the product of the Reformation, the Authorized King James Version of 1611.
