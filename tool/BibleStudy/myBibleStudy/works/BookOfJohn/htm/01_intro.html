	<strong><a><br />
	<br />
	Objective: </a></strong><br />
	<a>This class is for those who are new believers or those who love to read the Book of John, and want to explore further in order to grow in Him and to better lead the Gospels study in FG. The book of John is full of the message of the love of God and </a><a>emphasizes the personal relationship with Him</a><a>, which is the foundation to build each other in church (rather than flatery/glory to each other). This class will study the book of John from many different perspectives besides the natural sequential reading method. It helps Christians to better understand and remember the versus in book of John. </a></p>

	<strong>Why do we need to study the Bible in Sunday school?</strong></p>
<p>
	The Bible is the Word of God.(2Tim 3:16) Simply speaking, what we need is to read the Bible, to pray to God and to live out the life of Christ. The way of God is actually just so simple. "My yoke is easy and my burden is light," (Mat 11:30) The Fellowship Group Bible study is well enough for us. The way that we study the Bible in seminary school today is extremely scientific which will not garantee to increase the personal spiritual life. We do not need to learn the name of the writer for each book, its writing date, history background, genre etc. which are worldly things rather than heavenly things.The knowledge is unlimited but our life is limited. Worse, knowledge we learn today will soon pass away to become obsoleted. 
	</p>
<p>
	Then why do we need to attend Sunday school to study the Bible? 1) Jesus told us in his Greatest commandment."Love the Lord with all your heart and all your soul and with all your mind." (Mat 22:37) What we do here is just to use our mind--scientific thinking, which is the least important one. We learn more in order to love and serve the Lord more. If our study cannot lead to love the Lord, then it is vain. 2) To know more about HIM. the more we know HIM, the more we know ourselves--the mission of God 3) evangical missionary. 5) is a response of God's love. 6) defence the wicked attack from the world. 7) To expose the wicked teaching in the world. 
	</p>
<p>
	<strong><br />
	Why do we study the Gospel of John rather than Matthew, Mark or Luke?</strong><br />
	<br />
	1) BoJ is most different from other Gospels. (how)<br />
	a) Christian"s quote statistics: Matt:16, Mark:4, Luke:1, John:7 (...</a>)<br />
	b) length for passion week: 43%. others is 25-33%<br />
	c) testimony.</p>
<p>
	2) It is best fit for Chinese culture. (how)<br />
	logos, god, love, first-person for Jesus.<br />
	use of symbolism and double meaning.<br />
	use of the &ldquo;misunderstood statement.<br />
	&ldquo;kingdom of god&rdquo; versus &ldquo;eternal life.&rdquo;<br />
	realized eschatology in the gospel of john.</p>

	<strong>How do we study gospel of John?</strong>
<ol>
	<li>
		Biblical Study vs Scientific Study<br />
		<p>
			The word 'study' is a middle English, shortening of Old French estudie (noun), estudier (verb), both based on Latin studium ‘look at closely' and 'zeal, painstaking application.’ Today the word 'study' is a concept of western science which means to become to know clearly through evidence and logic. The evidence belongs to the  mateirials objective to huaman heart and mind. The logic belongs to the thinking activity of human mind. </p>

		<p>
			Any study can be scientific or bibically. The scientific study is based upon scientific evidence and scientific laws, both of which primarily come from the objective material in the world. But for the biblical study, its evidence is based upon biblical testimony, and its logic is based upon the biblical theological laws. Biblical study is different from Fellowship Group Bible Study (FGBS) which is primarily based on the testimony of brothers and sisters as well as the love of Jesus. 
			</p>

		<p>
			The scientific study is subject to turn to either atheism for science and technology or theism for any religon. Most people use worldly study to gain a degree to find a job to earn money, to buy house to accumulate 401k for euthanasian death. Some people use worldly study to develop his religion to struggle and die for his belief. </p>

		<p>
			The bibblical study is the study that is under the guide of the Holy Spirit. The purpose of biblical study is to lead people to believe in Jesus the son of God, to know/love/serve Him more, to go to missionary fields, to offer your body as living sacrifice, to satisfy God. The purpose of biblical study is same as what the Gospel of John deliveved the themes. 1) to testify the testimony is true (authentics) (John 21:24). 2) to believe Jesus is the Son of God, 3) to have eternal life by His name. (John 20:31).</p>
		<p >
			Chinese culture does not have concept of study. Instead they meditate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Scientific Evidence vs Biblical Testimony<br />
		<p>
			The English word "science" appeared in mid-14c, rooted from sci- (scissors), "cut, split, divide, seperate", implied "to distinguish true from false", denoted "what is known acquired by study", "assurance of knowledge, certitude, certainty", as "experiential knowledge;" From 17c.-18c. this concept commonly was used in philosophy. <!--Sense of "non-arts studies" is attested from 1670s.--> [<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/science">2</a>]</p>
		<p>
			The word "science" was first translated by Japanese as "科学" (literally means catagory knowledge) no later than 1864 (明治初年). Soon, the same Japanese term began to spread widely in China after it was used by Chinese scholar Kang YouWei (康有为, 1858-1927) in his book, The Japanese Catagory Record(日本书目志), which is published in 1897.</p>
		<p>
			Scientific evidence is evidence which serves to either support or counter a scientific theory or hypothesis. Such evidence is expected to be empirical evidence and interpretation in accordance with scientific method. Standards for scientific evidence vary according to the field of inquiry, but the strength of scientific evidence is generally based on the results of statistical analysis and the strength of scientific controls.
		</p>
		<p>The word "testimony" means "evidence, statement of a witness" first recorded early 15c., from Old French testimonie (11c.), from Latin testimonium "evidence, proof, testimony," from testis "witness".
		</p>
			Biblical Testimony is evidence which serves to testify the authenty of the biblical truth. Christians in general, especially within the Evangelical tradition, use the term "to testify" or "to give one's testimony" to mean "to tell the story of how one became a Christian". Commonly it may refer to a specific event in a Christian's life in which they believe God did something deemed particularly worth sharing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Today scientific method means to know things conscious surely through logc reasoning and experiments as contrast to subconscious, unconscious, uncertain folk religious doctrines.<br />
			<br />
			The key of scientific method is to use the scientific evidence (historical docuement, archeological hardwares, experiemental data, etc) and logic. The logic of scientific evidence method is like this: if all persons, all events or anythig related to Jesus are real, then Jesus is real. Ortherwise, Jesus is false.<br />
			<br />
			Scientific evidence (LunZhen/ZhenJu) is similar but dilfferent from testimony(JianZhen). Scientific evidence is something that has been tested to be true logically and practically. Testimony is something that has been testified to be true. The words "testimony" and "testify" both derive from the Latin word testis, referring to the notion of a disinterested third-party witness. Scientific evidence is of more natural material; biblical testimony is of supernatural, more human life. Whereas the biblical testimony focus more on the trinity God. (Exodus 20:16) Scientific evidence relies on logic; whereas the biblical testimony rely on the Mosaic laws. The biblical testimony was not only used by Jesus Himself (John 8:18) but also ordered to use for His disciples (Act 1:8).<br />
			<br />
			Scientific evidence can be considered as a modern way derived from the biblical testimony method. Scientific evidence cannot replace the biblical testimony. Either scientific evidence or biblical testimony is not necessary and sufficient condition for faith. There are four cases for a person:</p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				believe Jesus without evidence. Eg. John B., Simon,</li>
			<li>
				believe Jesus with evidence. Eg. Thomas.</li>
			<li>
				don"t believe Jesus with evidence. Eg. Pharisees, Dan.<br />
				"to shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them." (Mak6:11=Mat 10:14=Luk 9:5),<br />
				"none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah." (Mat 12:39=Luk 11:29)</li>
			<li>
				don"t believe Jesus without evidence. This is a reason for missionary.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The word "testimony" appeares about 104 times in the Bible, 47 in OT, 57 in NT, 32 in the Gospels, 15 in John. The word "witness" appeares about 106 in the Bible, 62 in OT, 44 in NT, 14 in the Gospels, 4 in John. The word "testimony" was used by Jesus: Mat 5, mak 3, luk 3, John 8. John: 5:31,32,34,36, 8:14,17; 19:35; 21:24. While articulating the high chritiology, the gospel of John also emphasized the its fundimental biblical testimony method used, which is another differences from synoptics.</p>
		<p>
			Science is dehuman. the prototype of evangelism. To ignore the science of contextualization is risky business. You may feel good that you are obedient in sharing the gosepel with a lost community but if no one understands your messag the lost remain lost. (Mission of God p421) Scientific evidence is used for the biblical testimony to testify Jesus Christ. Every true Christian has his own testimony of Jesus. Every testimony must be used with others publically to testify Jesus in all nations which the Great Commission Jesus gave to us.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Theological Anaylsis Method<br />
		<p>
			Scientific method is to use the scientific evidence or achievements as a tool to study the Bible. Although the theology itself is a scientific way, it results come from the Bible through abstration of the Bible rather than social and nature. Coming from the Bible and applied back into the Bible distinguish the theology from scientific displines in methodology. It is the combination of the biblical study and the wordly study.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Chronological Parallel Study Method
		<p>
			For the four books of the Gospels, there exists significant mount of similarities between them.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<strong>What is a Gospel?</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		The word gospel comes from Greek word euangelion (G2098), means "good news." It was used in ancient Greek for the announcement of military victories or other instances of good fortune (Bingo). For example, in the book of Aspien in 6 BC, the birthday of Caesar Augustus was described as "the beginning of his good messages" (gospel) (loc 190)
		<p>
			When the modern Olympics began in Athens in 1896, a race of 40 kilometers, or 24.85 miles, was held to commemorate the legend of Pheidippides. He is the messenger who is said to have run from Marathon to Athens to announce a Greek victory over the Persians at the Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C. Pheidippides is called a gospel runner in history.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Jesus refreshed the meaning of "gospel"--the real good news was the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven (Mark 1:15) and Jesus repeatedly used this word about 7 more times (Mat 24:14,26:13; Mark 13:10,14:9, 16:15; Luke 4:18,722) to proclaim that the gospel must be preached all nations. Gospel appeared 15 times in the Four Books of Gospels, 70 in Paul"s epistles, 101 in whole NT. The word "gospel" in NT originally was not refer to the presently Four Books of Gospels but the oral forms of preaching or story about the life of Jesus Christ. This is also a reason why  Roman persecuted Christians. The first verse of Mark, "The begining of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God." (Mark 1:1) was the directy chanllenge for its Roman rulers. As a contrast to the meaning of gospel on earth, Jesus convert gospel to be a bad news on earth--Jesus was nailed the cross--the symbol for shame and loser. The word gospel is a brand new term but has ancient old concept for OT. It is the organic union of the biblical prophecy, its fulfilment and its eternal existance. It is the core of the Bible. To use one symbol to represent the Bible is the cross; to use one word to represent the Bible is the word of Gospel. This is a grey point for Chinese culture that could not translate by machine. Indeed, Jesus is the author, designer, worker of the Gospel. Jesus is the Gospel. Jesus must be preached through out all nations. </li>
	<li>
		After the 2nd century, the word "gospel" began to be used to represent the four books of the Gospels in NT until today. The title forms are the gospel of John, the Book of John, the Gospel According to John.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<strong>The Formation of the Four Books of the Gospels</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Oral Forms:<br />
		Jesus of Nazareth left behind no written materials. Furthermore, there is no intention directly or indirectly that Jesus wanted his words to be written down. What Jesus wanted his followers to do is to preach/tell his story through out the world. For example, Jesus wanted the anoiting woman to be told in memory of her. (Mat 26:13) The original Gospels was formed in pure oral format and spread for about twenty years after ascesion.       </li>
	<li>
		Written Forms:<br />
		Three main factors drove oral form to be transformed into the writtern form.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				the increasing distance for mobile missionary administration. This can be clearly seen in epistle of Galatian and first Thessalonians which were written in ce. 50 after Paul&rsquo;s 1st Journey ended at Antioch at ce 50</li>
			<li>
				the increasing numbers of death of eyewitness.</li>
			<li>
				the increasing numbers of theological debates from inside and heresies from outside of Christianity community.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Without wittern forms, before all eyswitness passed away, the identification, authentication, forth back theological debate, purification, verification, universal recognation and finalization or canonization cannot be done. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Canonization <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canon">.</a>
		<p>
			The word canon borrowed from Old French canon, from Latin canōn, from Ancient Greek &kappa;&alpha;&nu;ώ&nu; (kanṓn, &ldquo;measuring rod/stick, standard&rdquo;), akin to &kappa;ά&nu;&nu;&alpha; (k&aacute;nna, &ldquo;reed&rdquo;), perhaps from Semitic (compare Hebrew קָנֶה&lrm; (qane, &ldquo;reed&rdquo;)). It means a generally accepted principle; an official rule and standard.</p>
		<p>
			Once a book is canonized, it is considered by permanent "closed"--it cannot be added or removed or modified), just like Roman Judaea Prefect Pilate said "What I have written, I have written."(John 19:22)</p>
		<p>
			There are many gospels along with the Four Gospels. Paul claimed that he preached gospel where Christ was not known. (Rom 15:20) At Paulian times, the Four Gospels was not completed yet. The gospel according to Paul can be called the Gospel of Paul. Paul repeated call the gospel he preached as "my gospel". (Rom 2:16,16:25) Paul also pointed out the different gospel. (Gal 1:6)</p>
