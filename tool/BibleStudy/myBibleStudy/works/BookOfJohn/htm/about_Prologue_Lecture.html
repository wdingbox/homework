					Mysticism 神秘主義: Chinese translation is not good. It should be 迷信主義 玄虚
 Agnostic不可知</p>
 <p>
 	“神秘主义”一词是从拉丁文occultism（意为“隐藏或隐蔽”）派生而来的，其基本含义是指能够使人们获得更高的精神或心灵之力的各种教义和宗教仪式。 神秘主义包括诸多经卷和主观验证方法，例如玄想、唯灵论、“魔杖”探寻、数灵论、瑜伽、自然魔术、自由手工匠、共济会纲领、巫术、星占学和炼金术等。
 </p>
 <p>
 	神秘主义（mysticism），此词在中文中的翻译易与Occultism混淆，关于这一点，著名台湾学者傅佩荣先生认为，应该把mysticism翻译为“密契主义”。密契就是密切契合，密契主义中，一个关键的概念就是“密契经验”即感觉自己的灵魂与一个至高的精神实体相契合的精神经验。
沈殿忠将神秘主义分为三种类型：一是宗教神秘主义，主要是指宗教徒信奉神灵的观念意识；二是一般神秘主义，主要是指日常生活中的人信奉神灵的观念意识；其三为邪教神秘主义或异端神秘主义，即一种同邪教组织相关的神秘主义。各类神秘主义的共同特征是“排斥感性认识到理性认识”这一实践过程的认识论和方法论。

					奥秘 unfathamable vs 秘密secret, deceit. and 真理 truth 
				</p>
				<p>
					Truth is power, false also the power. But their destination is completely different.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just like knowledge is power, secret is also power; deceit is power. LaoZi use the secret conqured all Chinese people's hearts for more than two thousands years. Many companies and governments still make use of the power of secret to control his people.
				</p>
				<p>
					老子的“道”与这奥秘颇有相似的地方，《道德经》声称“道”是不可言说、无名和玄奥的；老子称它为“无”，而这“无”不是绝对消极的，却蕴藏着圆满之“有”（《道德经》一章）。老子又以“夷”、“希”、“微”（《道德经》十四章）和“恍惚”、“窈冥”（《道德经》廿一章）等词形容“道”的隐晦深远。这“道”不但具有超越性，同时也内在于万物，畜养、亭毒众生（《道德经》五十一章）。“道”若指内蕴于万物的生命力时通常称为“德”（《道德经》五一，五五章）。“道”的玄奥深远与内在于万物的特性正好与“奥秘”的超越性与内在性相比。

					God has left his imprint in China. mariculious signs are not limited in Book of John. His miracles are unlimited. To speak to the soul of people rather that the flesh. 
				</p>
				<p> 
				The prologue started with Logos, which was an obsucure 晦涩 and unfathomable 难懂 concept left from Hellenic athesim period, that ultimately led to mysticism. The book of John did not critisize or attack it but draw it back to its the very beginning through furthing reasoning, and contextualize it through the truth light of the world--that was Jesus Christ, the Only Son of God. With Jesus Christ, all obscurity became explicity. The unfathamable thing became the grace. All all mysteries was gone but became His visible miracles and marvels, and more than that, all of us became part of miracles of Jesus Christ. &quot;From the fullness of His grace, we have all received one blessing after another.&quot; (1:16)</p>
				<p>
					Hellenic concept of logos is similar to Chinese Dao from many perspectives. Both appeared after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Both appeared during the sudden cultural thriving period around fifth century BC. Both got rid of the doctrines from the creator of the Lord. Both were liberated from legendary ritualism--no worship and no prayer, but fully counting on his own observation and free will. Both picked a word that had meaning of utterance to express their creative new concept. Both concepts infered a supernatural power--logos was behind nature continuum, Dao behind human deeds. But both ideas were obscure and unfathamable. Both left similar quantity of words: Heroclitus left about 130 verses of his quotes. LaoZi left 81 verses (5,000 character); But both played similar roles as foundation in its own culture and affected man until today. Being incomprehensible, both eventually led to many branches to from various mysticisms. </p>
				<p>
					mysticism is a vague speculation : a belief without sound basis. b : a theory postulating the possibility of direct and intuitive acquisition of ineffable knowledge or power. </p>
				<p>
					Dichonomy is different from mysticism. Dichonomy is amazing grace. mysticism is unreachable attractive temptation. 
				</p>				
				<p> 
					Mysticism makes use of the human curiosity to lead people enter into endless dead loop. It can be a religious believe, a philosophy, also it can be a game, a porn.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Heraclitus: "Although this Logos is eternally valid, yet men are unable to understand it -- not only before hearing it, but even after they have heard it for the first time. That is to say, although all things come to pass in accordance with this Logos, men seem to be quite without any experience of it - - - at least if they are judged in the light of such words and deeds as I am here setting forth according to its nature, and to specify how it behaves. Other men, on the contrary, are as unaware of what they do when awake as they are when asleep. (1)",
				</p>
				<p>
					DaoDeJing, "If the Dao could be said, then that was not the  Dao."	In another words, It "Can only be understood, can not be said" 只可意会，不可言传 (意之所随者，不可以言传也. 庄子·天道.
				</p>	

				<p>
					One of essential differences between them is that Hellenstic logos was developed based upon the observation of the natural cosmos and its continuum. Whereas Chinese Dao was based on the observation and deeply thinking of human beings' deeds and their desires.</p>
				<p>
					Heraclitus observed that one could not enter the same river twice--water kept flowing all the time. Likewise, the cosmos kept moving continiously. Behind the continuim movement of the cosmos, there is one he called it logos. Later on, Phlio of Alexandria (20 BC - 50 AD) personified it as &quot;He&quot;.</p>
				<p>
					Laozi observed that there was a kind of person who was weak but strong, who had no any desires but nothing he had not done, who did not contend but always win, who was the lowest in the world but all listened to him, who was weak without any capability but no one could destroy him, who lived simplly and naturally but enjoyed the peace, who died but not perished. LaoZi call a person with such characters as having De (virtue). The principles made behind the De was Dao. De was visible, but Dao was not only invisible but aslo could not be explicit uttered--when you spoke it, it was not it; when you named it, the name was not it. The personalities that Laoze described is very close to the characters of Jesus Christ and his followers. The difference is that one is out in, another is inside out. One is pretended, another is true vine.</p>
				<p>
					Hellenic Logos made people to be a scientist but with nearsight; Chinese Dao made people to be a ruler but with craft. Both make people hard to see the true light and difficult to understand the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Both focus on superfacial things: one was to buid the grand living material enviroment, one was to pretend the harmony personal relationships. Both developed the glorious and gorgious civilization but each individual gained nothing at the end.</p>
				<p>
					Hellenic logos was more practical than Chinese Dao. Alexanda the Great, a private student of Aristotle, successfully ruled over Africa, Eruop and Asai, proved that his Greek philosophy was appliable to the state government. At era of Daoism, none of Daoism believer ever became a successful model as what Dao taught. Both LaoZi and his famous follower ZhuangZi lived in a reclusive solitary life. Daoism was critized to be the spiritual tool for rulers to foolish its citizens.   
				</p>
				<p>
					Althogh cultures, history, race, languages, origination, etc. are all different, to translate Greek logos into Chinese Dao in CUV is a perfect match and second to none. It is another live miracle of Jesus in Book of John that occured in intercultural world of today. Only the Children of God can see such miriacles.  
				</p>
					
				<p> 
					”in book of John. It was a invisible testimony for Jesus Chirst.  who could bring together    the same that they were supper natural power, they were incomprehensive. with inter-culture Jesus is interculture. 	
					</p>
				<p>
					Another difference is that the ideaology of Hellenic logos was conquered after 1st century due to the spread of Christianity, especially the Gospel according to John, in Western world. Seldom people mention Hellenic logos today. </p>
				<p>
					Whereas Chinese Dao, since it was proposed by LaoZi, ruled over Chinese people for more than 2500 years. All Chinese people were under the Dao. Many people attacked or criticized it. But none of people in the world could even successfuly find out its critical point. No one was able to transcend it. One paradox "Dao is unspeakable" covered all people's mouths and ruled all people's minds and soul. Dao was like what DaoDeJing said: it did not do but none was not done. It was freely and unlimited penetrated deeply into every corner, every cell of its culture and still affect its people for more than two thousands yeard until today. 英国汉学家李约瑟认为：“中国文化就像一棵参天大树，而这棵大树的根在道家。But Chinese people seldom recognized that. People either developed to praise it or surrender under it. Many people kept silence about Dao but eventally died in such silence. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The 2500 years long history has provided the solid evidence: all people who grew up in Dao were not able to get rid of it. Mao initiated the Culture Revolution to intend to destroy it, but ended with failure--he was laughted by Dao. LuXun sharply pointed out the essence of Chinese culture was an people-eat-people culture. But he could do nothing about Dao. Today Dao began to challenge all Chinese Christians. Many scholars found the similairties between the DaoDeJing and the Bible. YuanZhiMing published a book, a greeting across the space. LaoZi finally met Jesus. But soon in China, the Bible was subverted as evidence for the greatness of Dao. Dao was glorified. "Dao was weak but strong."--the undescrible paradox mysterious feature successfully protected Dao to win in China. YuanZhiMing was soon critized by many scholars. Chinese Dao won again. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As China economy arises in the world, its assoicated thoughts of Dao also began to affect the world. How to handle Chinese Daoism is going to be the second most challeged missioonary work in Christian history after the Hellenistic logos thoughts. Daoism will test every Christian how much you understand and trust Jesus Christ. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For Chinese cultural missionary work, this short prologue would play significant and special important role for Chinese people missionaries to get rid of its dark rulers to turn to Christ. This is also the special feature that John can distinguish itself from synoptics on particular Chinese ethno group.   
				</p>
				<p>
					Chinese people always think the Jesus Christ belongs to Israel culture and has nothing to do with Chinese. Some scholars say that the Bible never mention Chinese at all. The CUV verson of the Gospel of John was indeed exactly the book written for Chinese.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to some scholars, the aplogists developed the Logos doctrine in order to describe satisfactorily the divine indwelling, the incarnation. In John's Gospel, this term is used in the explanation of how God himself was involved in human life and in the world. For the apologists, however, the Logos seems to have been conceived of as hovering between God and the world.  The logos was one with God and yet not Gode. With the help of this idea the early Christian writers were able to affirm a relationship between God and the world and at the same time hang on to their desire to isolate God from any immediate intercourse with the world.

					In John, the term logos is picked up, and translated as "Word" in our English Bibles. Logos is an encultured term with all sorts of culturally loaded meanings in ancient Greek culture. According to the ancient Greeks, logos was the organizing principle of the universe. To understand the shock of Johm's using logs, this is the quivalent of a Star Wars geek saying, "The force became flesh." Or a Chinese person saying, "The tao became flesh."

				<p>
					John is not to glory Heraclitus but Jesus Christ. It is not to develope to glorify Chinese culture, but to glorify Jesus his grace. 

				</p>
				<p>
					Why did John choose to call Jesus the logos in the prologue to his gospel? 
					The main reason lies with his audience. John gave no explanation of the logos, apparently assuming his readeres would understand the idea. Greek readers would probably think he was referring to the rational principle that guided the universe and would be shocked to find that this logos had become not only personalized but incarnate. Jewish readers would be more prepared for some sort of personalized preexistent Wisdom לוגו, but they too would be amazed at the idea of incarnation. John presented Jesus as the true logos as preparation for his own presentation of Jesus as the Son of God. 

					A distinction must be kept in mind between John's conceptual background and his desire to contextualize his messsage to a particular audience. "This desire to conextualize his message may have led John to use a term that had currency among his readers in order to persuade themof the relevance of his gospel. Yet even if John used the term Logos because it served his purpose of communicating to a Hellenistic audience, this does not mean that he used the expression in the way in which it was commonly used in the world of his day;"

					The logos in John is the Heraclitus logos, the logos of John is Jesus Christ.

Background concept of the term "word" or "spoken word" (i.e., 20,2,4, BDB 180, KB 210 II)

1. Hebrew background

a. the power of the spoken word (Isa. 55:11; Ps. 33:6,9; 107:20; 147:15,18), as in Creation (Gen. 1:3,6,9,11,14,20,24, 26,29) and the Patriarchal blessing (Gen. 27:1ff; 49:1) 

b. Proverbs 8:12-23 personifies "Wisdom" as God's first creation and agent of all creation (cf. Ps. 33:6 and the non-canonical Wisdom of Solomon, 9:9)

c. God's control of nature (cf. Ps. 147:12-20; 148:8) and angels (cf. Ps. 103:19-20)

d. the Targums (Aramaic translations and commentaries) substitute the phrase "Word of God" for logos because of their discomfort with anthropomorphic terms

2. Greek background (logos)

a. Heracleitus – the world was in flux; the impersonal divine and unchanging logos (i.e. law) held it together and guided the changing process

b. Plato – the impersonal and unchanging logos kept the planets on course and determined the seasons

c. Stoics – the logos was the "world reason" or manager, but was semi-personal (possibly from Anaxagoras)

d. Philo – he personified the concept of logos as "High Priest that set the soul of man before God," or "the bridge between man and God," or "the tiller by which the Pilot of the universe steers all things" (kosmocrater).  He called the Logos, God's "first-born son" and God's "Ambassador" or God's "Advocate."  He emphasized God's transcendence and the Logos was the link to the physical realm.

				Dualism 二元论: 

			<p>
				1755 as a term in philosophy, &quot;a way of thinking which explains phenomena by the assumption of two independent and absolute elements,&quot; from French dualisme (1754); see dual + -ism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Theological sense of &quot;doctrine of two independent divine beings or eternal principles&quot; is by 1847. General sense of &quot;division into two&quot; is by 1831. 
			</p>	
			<p>
				In general, the idea is that, for some particular domain, there are two fundamental kinds or categories of things or principles. the division of something conceptually into two opposed or contrasted aspects, or the state of being so divided. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The term &lsquo;dualism&rsquo; has a variety of uses in the history of thought.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dualism contrasts with monism, which is the theory that there is only one fundamental kind, category of thing or principle; and, rather less commonly, with pluralism, which is the view that there are many kinds or categories. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In theology, for example a &lsquo;dualist&rsquo; is someone who believes that Good and Evil&mdash;or God and the Devil&mdash;are independent and more or less equal forces in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the philosophy of mind, dualism is the theory that the mental and the physical&mdash;or mind and body or mind and brain&mdash;are, in some sense, radically different kinds of thing. Plato believed that the true substances are not physical bodies, which are ephemeral, but the eternal Forms of which bodies are imperfect copies. These Forms not only make the world possible, they also make it intelligible, because they perform the role of universals, or what Frege called &lsquo;concepts&#39;. It is their connection with intelligibility that is relevant to the philosophy of mind. Because Forms are the grounds of intelligibility, they are what the intellect must grasp in the process of understanding. In Phaedo Plato presents a variety of arguments for the immortality of the soul, but the one that is relevant for our purposes is that the intellect is immaterial because Forms are immaterial and intellect must have an affinity with the Forms it apprehends (78b4&ndash;84b8). This affinity is so strong that the soul strives to leave the body in which it is imprisoned and to dwell in the realm of Forms. It may take many reincarnations before this is achieved. Plato&#39;s dualism is not, therefore, simply a doctrine in the philosophy of mind, but an integral part of his whole metaphysics. Descartes&#39; theory. Descartes was a substance dualist. He believed that there were two kinds of substance: matter, of which the essential property is that it is spatially extended; and mind, of which the essential property is that it thinks. Whether or not Isaiah 45:7 is a polemical reference to Persian dualism (see above), it is evident that dualistic tendencies asserted themselves in t &quot;a dualism between man and nature&quot; 2. the quality or condition of being dual; duality.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Daoism, yin and yang.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Book of John, dualism is the light and darkness, believe and disblieve, world or kingdom of heaven.
