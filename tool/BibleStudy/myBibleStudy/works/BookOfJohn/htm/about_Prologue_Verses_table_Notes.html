								eternal: no beginning&nbsp;no ending.&nbsp;I-am-who-I-am</li>
							<li>
								everlasting/forever/immortal: has a beginning but no ending. Kingdom of Havean.</li>
							<li>
								no such English word to express it has both beginning and ending. But many things has beginning and ending like the worldly life. Jesus is the only one who has both--&quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&quot; (Rev 22:13)</li>
							<li>
								Logos, rhema == word, saying, utterance.</li>
							<li>
								was vs created (Gen 1:1)</li>
						</ol>
						<ol>
							1b: The preposition &quot;with&quot; implies that
							<li>
								The Word is different from God. The Word and God are two entities.</li>
							<li>
								The Word and God coexist or stay together all the times. It means that the Word is the same eternal as God, the same as I-am-who-I-am, what God claimed.</li>
						</ol>
						<ol>
							1c:
							<li>
								John 1:1c &quot;was&quot; means that the two entities, the Word and God, are one the same. The Word and God have no relationship of creation. The Word is equal to God in divinity, which means that the Word has exactly all what God has.</li>
							<li>
								Moreover, John 1:1c &quot;The Word was God&quot; is different from &quot;the Word was a god.&quot; The Word is holy unique. The Word is &quot;the One and Only&quot;. (1:14,18)</li>
						</ol>
						<ol>
							b and c
							<li>
								dichotomy (trichotomy) vs contradict,paradox,mysticism: a division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different.</li>
							<li>
								John's dualism vs others: accept and refuse.</li>
