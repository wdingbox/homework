   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>1:26</b> And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>1:30</b> And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for
   thou hast found favour with God.</p>

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>1:31</b> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>1:35</b> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy

   born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p>

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>1:36</b> And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>24:31</b> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and
   he vanished out of their sight.</p>

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>24:32</b> And they said one to another, Did not our heart
   burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while
   he opened to us the scriptures?</p>

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>24:33</b> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to
   Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>24:35</b> And they told what things <i>were done</i> in the

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>24:36</b> And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the
   midst of them, and saith unto them, <font class='jw'>Peace

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>24:37</b> But they were terrified and affrighted, and

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>24:39</b> <font class='jw'>Behold my hands and my feet,

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>24:40</b> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>24:42</b> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and
