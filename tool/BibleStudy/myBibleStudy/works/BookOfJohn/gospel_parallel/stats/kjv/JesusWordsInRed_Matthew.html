   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">

   <b>27:38</b> Then were there two thieves crucified with him,

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:48</b> And straightway one of them ran, and took a

   <b>27:54</b> Now when the centurion, and they that were with

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:55</b> And many women were there beholding afar off,

   <b>27:57</b> When the even was come, there came a rich man of

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:58</b> He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:59</b> And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it
   in a clean linen cloth,</p>

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:60</b> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn
   out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
   sepulchre, and departed.</p>

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:61</b> And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary,
   sitting over against the sepulchre.</p>

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:62</b> Now the next day, that followed the day of the
   preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto
   Pilate,</p>

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:63</b> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said,
   while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</p>

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:64</b> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure
   until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and
   steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the
   dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</p>

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:65</b> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>27:66</b> So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing
   the stone, and setting a watch.</p>
