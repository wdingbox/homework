   <b>16:5</b> And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young
   man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment;

   <p class="bivers" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in">
   <b>16:6</b> And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek

   <b>16:9</b> Now when <i>Jesus</i> was risen early the first
