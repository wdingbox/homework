1
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:01,797
Spice for the front page, isn't it?

2
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:04,797
All you can think of are
headlines for the front page.

3
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:06,143
Oh, drop it!

4
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:07,501
Here comes Judge Raghunath.

5
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:26,618
Such a gentleman! Why on earth
did that goon want to kill him?

6
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,409
Here comes your friend.

7
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:03,637
Is the jury in place?
- Yes, my Lord. Present.

8
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:06,244
Is the accused present?
- Present, my Lord.

9
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:08,276
Who is the counsel for the accused?

10
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,458
Who is the counsel for the accused?

11
00:05:19,13 --> 00:05:21,513
Have you no lawyer
to defend your case?

12
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,140
In that case, the government...
- My Lord.

13
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,764
I'm the counsel for the accused.

14
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:49,632
I do not wish to defend myself.

15
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:57,299
I promised to defend you,
if you're ever arraigned. Remember?

16
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:00,257
Does the accused give his consent?

17
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:07,632
Yes.

18
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:16,104
Raj, you have been accused of
a murderous attack on Judge Raghunath.

19
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:19,299
You may plead your case.

20
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,910
I swear to speak the truth.

21
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:36,921
Judge Raghunath, can you tell us
why the accused tried to kill you?

22
00:06:37,97 --> 00:06:38,909
Did he have any enmity with you?

23
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:45,952
Yes. The grudge that a born
felon bears...

24
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:52,325
against the judge who sentences
him and grants no reprieve.

25
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:55,25
Could there be no other reason
for such animosity?

26
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:59,244
None. How else could I relate to him?

27
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,910
I have no further questions.

28
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,522
Defense may proceed with
cross-questioning.

29
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,569
Judge, you are senior to me.

30
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:28,621
If in the course of questioning,
I happen to affront you do forgive me.

31
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:33,861
Someone's life is at stake.
And you have taught me...

32
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,444
to ignore all relationships for
the dispensation of justice.

33
00:07:42,69 --> 00:07:46,744
This is my first interrogation.
Please give me your blessings.

34
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:56,604
What do you mean when you call
the accused a born felon?

35
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:59,270
He has been a tramp and a hoodlum...

36
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,614
ever since he was a child.
His record says it.

37
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:05,520
This penchant for crime has surely
been transmitted congenitally.

38
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:08,811
Judge, do you have any children?

39
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:10,358
No

40
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:13,275
But how is this question relevant
to this case?

41
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:19,983
Most relevant. Think again. Are you
certain that you have no children?

42
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:25,317
No. But I reiterate. This question...
- Can you recount the circumstance...

43
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,108
when you threw your wife
out of your house?

44
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,631
My Lord, am I to be forced to reply
to such meaningless questions?

45
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:39,317
Ms Rita, you may ask questions
relevant only to the case.

46
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:43,410
We wish to know whether or not,
the accused attempted murder.

47
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:44,919
If yes, then why?

48
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:49,540
Enough! Stop it! I'm a murderer!
Hang me if you will!

49
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,82
Order! Order!

50
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:53,957
Proceed with your questioning.

51
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:58,540
The accused does not deny having
assaulted Judge Raghunath.

52
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:03,832
But, as you said just now,
the question is why he did it.

53
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,707
This interrogation is meant
to reveal the answer...

54
00:09:07,59 --> 00:09:12,82
if you my Lord, and Judge Raghunath
repose your trust in me for a while

55
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,540
You may proceed.

56
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,669
I repeat my question.
Can you recount the circumstance...

57
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:22,582
when you threw your wife
out of your house?

58
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:27,655
I beg your pardon, Judge Raghunath,
but this question is very important.

59
00:09:28,51 --> 00:09:30,415
And not only for the accused.
For you too.

60
00:09:31,40 --> 00:09:34,582
The cause of whatever is happening
today, lies rooted in your past.

61
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:37,332
Remember?

62
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:40,332
Remember?

63
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:45,874
Can you tell us? Why, when
and under what circumstance...

64
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,582
did you throw your wife
out of your house?

65
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:52,6
Why, when and under what circumstance...

66
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,725
..did you throw your wife
out of your house?

67
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,877
Why, when and under what circumstance...

68
00:09:57,957 --> 00:10:00,207
..did you throw your
wife out of your house?

69
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:03,404
24 years ago...

70
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:05,405
I was practicing law in Lucknow.

71
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:10,62
I was the black sheep of the family,
because I opposed social norm...

72
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:14,342
and I had married a widow.
My father was a big gun.

73
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:18,169
And was away in Bombay most of the time.
He was unhappy with me.

74
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:21,153
But under no circumstance,
was I willing to leave Leela.

75
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:25,368
She was so good to me.
She was such a good woman.

76
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:29,546
And I was in love with her.

77
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:33,236
But once, on our way from
Kanpur to Allahabad...

78
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:35,673
little did I realise that
like a boat in midstream...

79
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:39,353
my life too was to be caught
in cross currents.

80
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:52,811
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

81
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:58,872
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

82
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:00,536
"Be prudent, be prudent."

83
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,953
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

84
00:11:03,33 --> 00:11:04,870
"Be prudent, be prudent."

85
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:06,997
"I can't think straight."

86
00:11:07,78 --> 00:11:09,36
"Be prudent, be prudent."

87
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:11,120
"I can't think straight."

88
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,786
"Be prudent, be prudent."

89
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:15,247
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

90
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:16,995
"Be prudent, be prudent."

91
00:11:17,78 --> 00:11:21,372
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

92
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:26,370
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

93
00:11:30,66 --> 00:11:34,979
"The clear open sky over the head."

94
00:11:35,59 --> 00:11:38,315
"The clear open sky."

95
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,935
"Be prudent, boatman.
There is storm in your boat."

96
00:11:44,15 --> 00:11:48,168
"There is storm in your boat."

97
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:50,648
"The deep capricious waves."

98
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,567
"Be prudent, be prudent."

99
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:54,747
"The deep capricious waves."

100
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:56,454
"Be prudent, be prudent."

101
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,867
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

102
00:11:58,947 --> 00:12:00,537
"Be prudent, be prudent."

103
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:04,901
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

104
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:09,690
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

105
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:17,385
"A piece of the glass floats away."

106
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:23,498
"The iron too drowns."

107
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:29,111
"What are you thinking?"

108
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,24
"Be prudent, be prudent."

109
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:33,152
"What are you thinking?"

110
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:34,857
"Be prudent, be prudent."

111
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:37,236
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

112
00:12:37,316 --> 00:12:38,899
"Be prudent, be prudent."

113
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:41,274
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

114
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:42,940
"Be prudent, be prudent."

115
00:12:43,24 --> 00:12:47,248
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

116
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:52,107
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

117
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:35,892
"Be prudent, be prudent."

118
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,292
Aren't you feeling sleepy?

119
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:48,292
What are you thinking about?
- Why do they sing "Beware"?

120
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:54,958
They say, these parts are dangerous.
Jagga the bandit. He's from these parts.

121
00:13:55,38 --> 00:13:58,698
Bandits?
- Yes, but don't worry.

122
00:13:59,85 --> 00:14:01,708
As of now, he must be fast asleep
in some prison.

123
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,944
Go to bed. I'm feeling sleepy.

124
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,598
In case you're afraid, I can come over.
- No.

125
00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:19,593
Leela!

126
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:28,758
No! The lady is with them!

127
00:15:01,6 --> 00:15:04,194
Leave me! Leave me! Leave me!

128
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,810
You heartless bandits!

129
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,310
Where's your chief?

130
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,95
What right have you to terrorise
women from good families?

131
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:27,822
Aren't you ashamed?
- Ashamed?

132
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:30,863
Shame is for good folks,
not for bandits and robbers.

133
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:36,488
As for me, my grandfather was a bandit,
my father was a bandit! But I wasn't.

134
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:41,738
And your husband went and made me one!
- My husband?

135
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:46,72
Who are you?
- Jagga. And I was innocent.

136
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:51,488
But without a shard of evidence,
your husband framed me...

137
00:15:51,822 --> 00:15:55,322
just because my father, my grandfather
were bandits.

138
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,421
He framed me for rape
and he sent me to jail.

139
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,863
So I've decided to prove
your husband right.

140
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:09,488
Coward!

141
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,322
See what's wrong with her.

142
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:21,280
Has she come to her senses?

143
00:16:22,67 --> 00:16:26,363
No, she's still in a swoon.

144
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:32,405
Let her go, Chief. She's pregnant.
She's going to become a mother.

145
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:36,363
Touch her, and you go to hell.

146
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,562
Pregnant? With a baby?

147
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,656
Her husband said that children born
of good folks turn out good.

148
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:52,906
And children born of bandits...

149
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,72
turn out to be bandits. Always.

150
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:03,857
Now let's see what the lawyer's son
turns out to be.

151
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,439
Send her back once she recovers.

152
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:18,149
Good are those born of good folks!
And of bandits are bandits born.

153
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:27,478
You should make me a gift.
- What's the occasion?

154
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:29,808
Not any occasion.
The lady is back.

155
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:34,87
What did you say? The lady?

156
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:36,100
Leela!

157
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:38,975
Leela!

158
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:43,808
Why is it dark in here?

159
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,770
Nathu! Bansi! Naina!

160
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,350
Lights! Tonight we celebrate!

161
00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:52,725
Leela.

162
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:57,183
It is you who lights up my life.

163
00:17:57,725 --> 00:17:58,975
Leela.

164
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:10,517
Now that you're back,
even the lights seem so bright!

165
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,708
Give me the wick.

166
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:26,225
But Leela, how did you escape?
I hope you weren't in danger?

167
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:31,483
Your love was with me.
How could anyone even look up at me?

168
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:37,244
You are tired. Change.
I'll bring you your dressing gown.

169
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,93
These last four days.

170
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:55,58
The last four days were
like a lifetime.

171
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:58,392
I took the police and I looked
everywhere for you.

172
00:18:58,695 --> 00:19:00,191
All the while, I feared...

173
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:16,808
I feared you were in grave danger!

174
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:27,933
But how did you escape?
And who was this bandit?

175
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:31,975
Some Jagga.
He said that you had convicted him.

176
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:34,16
Jagga.

177
00:19:35,35 --> 00:19:41,345
So he escaped to get even with me!
If he has done anything to you...

178
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:45,908
I'll see to it that he hangs!
- At heart, he's a devil.

179
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:48,892
But God saved me at the last moment.
Thank God!

180
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:52,984
Tell me something.

181
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,734
Ask.

182
00:19:57,12 --> 00:20:02,572
Does a bandit's son necessarily
become a bandit?

183
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:04,901
Yes, it's bound to happen.

184
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:11,633
But why do you ask?
- Just like that.

185
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:26,211
Let's see what comes first.
Your becoming a magistrate, or...

186
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,794
Why? Is someone expected?

187
00:20:31,782 --> 00:20:33,336
A new guest.

188
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:38,211
Now I don't have any chances
of becoming a magistrate.

189
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,168
Why? What happened?

190
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:46,711
Whatever...
let's talk of something else.

191
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,336
How do you like this?

192
00:20:56,44 --> 00:20:57,378
Nice.

193
00:20:58,306 --> 00:20:59,628
Nice.

194
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:03,919
Listen...
Are you annoyed with me?

195
00:21:07,378 --> 00:21:10,187
Annoyed? No.

196
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,128
Why should I be annoyed with you?

197
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:18,941
Have my lunch sent over.

198
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:30,77
What's the matter?
Where are the servants?

199
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,116
God knows! Maybe they're all dead!
I have to do all the chores.

200
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:36,574
Let me help you.
- You'd rather tell her all this.

201
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:38,238
She's sitting around like a queen!

202
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:43,988
Not to be cross with Leela.
I told her not to strain herself.

203
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:49,80
You know the condition she is in.
And in a few days from now...

204
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,990
She's going to bear the fruit
of her sins!

205
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,821
What are you saying?!
- What everyone else is saying!

206
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,863
For four days, she lived with a bandit!
And Jagga that!

207
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,857
Don't you remember what
he was convicted for?

208
00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:10,321
Do you enjoy making someone unhappy?
The jaundiced eye sees all yellow.

209
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:12,988
Do you think you're beyond scrutiny?
Don't you forget...

210
00:22:13,68 --> 00:22:16,113
women have had to stand the test of
chastity. Because society asks for it.

211
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:17,866
Bhabhi! (Sister-in-law)

212
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,915
Forgive me Bhabhi,
your pot is broken.

213
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:29,780
It's only an earthen pot. But remember,
a woman's honour is far more fragile.

214
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,71
Once disgraced, her honour
can never be redeemed.

215
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:03,550
Just answer my question!

216
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:06,922
Did you not know that your wife
was seeing her lover on the sly?

217
00:23:07,2 --> 00:23:10,807
The villagers used to say that.
But I didn't heed what they said.

218
00:23:11,30 --> 00:23:14,215
You haven't yet told the court
why your wife deserted you.

219
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:18,23
You know it! Women are adulterous!
- I know what that means!

220
00:23:29,296 --> 00:23:33,615
Raghu, how can you lose
your cool in court?

221
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:37,657
I'm afraid your chances of
magistrate ship may be clouded.

222
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:45,282
Chances of a magistrate ship?
That's out of question now.

223
00:23:47,878 --> 00:23:52,610
Can a lawyer whose wife is under
suspicion ever become a magistrate?

224
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,740
Raghu!

225
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:56,740
The whole town is agog!
- What are you saying?

226
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,740
Aren't you ashamed to talk like this
about your wife?

227
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:04,311
I'm just saying what everyone is saying.

228
00:24:04,391 --> 00:24:06,198
Let them say what they want.

229
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:13,364
You're right. That's what I decided.

230
00:24:14,23 --> 00:24:16,231
Let them say what they want.

231
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:21,786
But how do I get rid of the suspicion?
It's like a leech sucking on...

232
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:25,720
some dark corner of my mind!
- What now?

233
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:49,588
Nathu! Naina! Bhabhi!

234
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:51,754
Where's everyone?

235
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:55,778
Send Bhabhi over to me.

236
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:02,436
I am scared.

237
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:05,700
Why isn't someone coming to me?

238
00:25:06,78 --> 00:25:09,782
That's my husband.
Please, send him over to me.

239
00:25:15,337 --> 00:25:16,616
Look Raghu...

240
00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:21,51
I'm telling you again! That baby
isn't going to be born in this house

241
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:24,513
If she wants to have her bastard,
let her go elsewhere.

242
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:27,51
I'm not going to let the honour
of my family be tainted.

243
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:30,51
I'm going to throw this
wanton woman out!

244
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:34,208
No! I'm not going anywhere!
No one can take me away from here!

245
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:39,676
He knows that I'm innocent!
He trusts me, he trusts me!

246
00:25:45,698 --> 00:25:48,885
You're here! Now I'm afraid of no one!

247
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:53,635
Have you heard?
They want to throw me out!

248
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:59,93
They say I'm a wanton woman!
They say, I've no right to be here!

249
00:26:00,296 --> 00:26:04,551
But now you're here.
No one will dare anymore.

250
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:10,874
Tell them I'm untainted!
Tell them you trust me.

251
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:14,968
Tell them I'm mothering your child.

252
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,702
Have you fallen for what they say?

253
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,819
You're the one who told me...
I don't care for the barking dogs.

254
00:26:44,13 --> 00:26:48,822
If you desert me, who else
in this world can I turn to?

255
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:53,906
Tell me... tell me that you trust me!

256
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:57,804
Do you think you're above scrutiny?

257
00:26:57,885 --> 00:27:00,531
Don't you forget women have
had to stand the test of chastity.

258
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:20,479
Why are you quiet?
Speak... speak!

259
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:27,354
You can see the state I'm in.
I'm afraid... afraid!

260
00:27:28,444 --> 00:27:33,562
I'm going to become a mother
...the mother of your child.

261
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:41,119
Have mercy! This is your baby.
This baby is yours!

262
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:43,99
Get out!
Get out of here!

263
00:27:58,266 --> 00:28:03,599
"A dutiful wife like Sita."

264
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:14,196
"You gave exile to her."

265
00:28:14,801 --> 00:28:23,130
"Why didn't the earth rip apart?"

266
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:29,965
"Why didn't the sky rip apart?"

267
00:28:30,955 --> 00:28:35,121
"Women have to endure injustice."

268
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:39,772
"Women have to endure injustice."

269
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:43,381
"The dear one of Lord Ram."

270
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:47,384
"Women have to endure injustice."

271
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:51,301
"Women have to endure injustice."

272
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:55,301
"Women have to endure injustice."

273
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:59,589
"Women have to endure injustice."

274
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:03,905
"Look, the King of the palace."

275
00:29:03,985 --> 00:29:07,51
"What a game is he playing!"

276
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:10,339
"What a game is he playing!"

277
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,848
"Look, the King of the palace."

278
00:29:25,928 --> 00:29:28,861
"What a game is he playing!"

279
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:32,215
"What a game is he playing!"

280
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:36,884
"From the shell, a pearl,
and in the muck."

281
00:29:36,964 --> 00:29:40,618
"The beautiful lotus is blossoming."

282
00:29:40,698 --> 00:29:44,173
"The beautiful lotus is blossoming."

283
00:29:48,89 --> 00:29:52,89
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

284
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:56,655
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

285
00:29:56,735 --> 00:30:00,33
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

286
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:05,75
"Congratulations, Lawyer!
A son has born to you."

287
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:09,616
Son of a decent family!
Born in a filthy gutter!

288
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:15,700
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

289
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,536
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

290
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:23,78
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

291
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:25,453
Do you not know what your wife
and your son went through...

292
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,918
after you shut your doors on them?
- No

293
00:30:28,998 --> 00:30:30,825
Nor did you try to find out.

294
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:33,858
But I can tell you.

295
00:30:35,322 --> 00:30:39,24
To get out of your way,
your wife left Lucknow.

296
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:44,662
And your innocent son grew up
in a Bombay slum.

297
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:49,108
One day...

298
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:58,687
Police! Scram!

299
00:31:05,35 --> 00:31:07,21
Greetings, sir.

300
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:13,979
Hey Nathu...
- Hello, Constable.

301
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:18,82
What are you up there like a monkey?
Why don't you go to school?

302
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:22,396
At school, the master asks for fees.

303
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:26,687
My father hasn't the money
to send me to school.

304
00:31:27,83 --> 00:31:29,937
Look at Leela's son, Raj.
He lives in this slum too.

305
00:31:30,241 --> 00:31:34,271
His mother is worse off. Yet she
sends her boy to such a big school.

306
00:31:35,748 --> 00:31:39,104
What did you say? He isn't a boy.
He's a sissy!

307
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:47,385
Ma, why do you put oil in my hair?
- Oil keeps the hair soft.

308
00:31:47,624 --> 00:31:50,245
But why do boys in the
neighbourhood call me sissy?

309
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,710
So what?
How do they compare with you?

310
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:56,510
You're a good boy
who goes to school.

311
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:59,10
You'll grow up to become
an educated man.

312
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:02,427
And those vagabonds will go to jail.

313
00:32:03,65 --> 00:32:04,802
Mother, who are called vagabonds?

314
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,83
The ones who just tramp around.

315
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:11,802
Those who think that whatever
belongs to others, belongs to them.

316
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:15,666
Those who gamble and drink
instead of going to school.

317
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:17,624
And they have fun!

318
00:32:19,23 --> 00:32:21,581
Ma, when I grow up,
I'll become vagabond too.

319
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:26,749
Nonsense! You'll become a lawyer.

320
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:30,682
Then a magistrate.

321
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,602
And then, a judge.

322
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,193
Raj!

323
00:32:35,265 --> 00:32:36,265
Raj!

324
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,987
You're sitting here?
Everyone's out there buying chocolates.

325
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:44,386
I don't have money

326
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:47,306
Why, doesn't your mother
give you money?

327
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:49,886
Daddy gives me a whole Rupee every day!

328
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,683
You're rich. And I'm poor.

329
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,136
Eat this
- No.

330
00:32:55,452 --> 00:32:57,302
Ma says never ask
for anything to eat.

331
00:32:57,472 --> 00:32:59,886
If she told you not to ask,
go ahead and snatch it.

332
00:33:03,94 --> 00:33:04,52
Wild!

333
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:06,11
Wild?
- No, no, no.

334
00:33:07,957 --> 00:33:10,469
You're coming to my place
this evening, aren't you?

335
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:13,437
Why, what's happening?
- My birthday party!

336
00:33:13,518 --> 00:33:15,174
You must come! It's going to be fun!

337
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:20,52
You know, Daddy has ordered
such a huge cake!

338
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:23,472
Happy birthday to you!

339
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:26,802
Happy birthday to you!

340
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:34,718
Happy birthday to you!

341
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,719
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

342
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:38,761
Let's go and eat ice cream.

343
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:52,569
Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?

344
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:57,111
I didn't have money to buy anything.
I'll give you some other time.

345
00:33:57,509 --> 00:34:00,569
Must you only buy something
to make a gift?

346
00:34:01,704 --> 00:34:05,581
You can give me a flower.
- Really?

347
00:34:12,402 --> 00:34:13,901
Here you are.

348
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:17,987
Someday, I'm going to make
lots of money.

349
00:34:18,67 --> 00:34:21,484
And I'll buy a gift for you.
Something better than all this.

350
00:34:22,275 --> 00:34:23,525
Do that.

351
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:26,609
But can anything be better
than this flower?

352
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:30,24
Ritu! Ritu! Your father
is calling you! - Coming!

353
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,150
Come on Raj, meet my father.

354
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,942
You always say this.

355
00:34:42,25 --> 00:34:44,400
Ritu, say hello to the Judge"

356
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,400
Hello, Judge.

357
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:48,482
Bless you.

358
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:53,429
You've grown up in these four years
You must've forgotten me.

359
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:56,804
Happy birthday

360
00:34:57,594 --> 00:35:02,12
I've just arrived from Lucknow.
I owe you a present.

361
00:35:03,816 --> 00:35:07,636
As of now, I can give you a flower.

362
00:35:09,158 --> 00:35:12,261
Here you are.

363
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:17,471
Let me put it on your hair.

364
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:21,887
Someone has already put a flower
over there.

365
00:35:22,143 --> 00:35:24,512
Raj has given me this flower

366
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:28,11
Daddy, this is Raj.
He's in my class.

367
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:29,971
I see.
- Hello.

368
00:35:30,54 --> 00:35:32,762
Hello.
- Hello.

369
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:35,637
God bless you, son"

370
00:35:37,224 --> 00:35:40,336
Raj says that he will become a judge
when he grows up.

371
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,911
Very good!

372
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:47,137
Your father must be a real gentleman.

373
00:35:48,12 --> 00:35:49,387
What does your father do?

374
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:53,54
I don't have my father.
I have only my mother

375
00:35:54,968 --> 00:35:57,761
Has he passed away?
- No! Don't say that!

376
00:35:57,851 --> 00:36:02,675
My mother says he is alive.
But...

377
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:07,988
He doesn't live with you
...and you haven't seen him either?

378
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:12,299
Your father is a strange man.
- Not a word about my father.

379
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,49
Else... else...

380
00:36:16,724 --> 00:36:18,413
Raj!
- Rita!

381
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:25,240
How can you let your daughter
play with boys like him?

382
00:36:26,472 --> 00:36:28,41
Go to play, Ritu"

383
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:32,511
Why, what's wrong with the boy?
I like him.

384
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:37,774
He doesn't even know his father's
name, and you like him?

385
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:40,859
I'd say he's just a wastrel
- Forget it.

386
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,274
Must you hang on to
those rotten old ideas?

387
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,649
What was the Bandit's name?

388
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:48,940
Yes, Jagga.

389
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:52,649
I remember you saying the same
at his trial.

390
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:57,232
That a bandit's son
always becomes a bandit.

391
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:58,939
I still stand by that principle.

392
00:36:59,24 --> 00:37:04,402
Principles, principles and principles!
It's because of these blind dogmas...

393
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:06,565
that you lost someone
as precious as Leela.

394
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:09,864
And because of your principles,
you never married again.

395
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:12,609
The dry parched desert that
your life is, is your own doing.

396
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,524
So much so that you would rather
destroy a friendship...

397
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:17,314
between two innocent children?
Why, what has the poor child done...

398
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:19,440
to bring you to harm?

399
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:22,815
Not this boy. But it was...

400
00:37:23,178 --> 00:37:28,524
someone like him who destroyed my life
...and brought me to disgrace.

401
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:31,607
Maybe today, he too says
what this boy just said...

402
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:36,357
I'm only my mother's son
...I have no father.

403
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:41,649
In every urchin I see him...

404
00:37:43,24 --> 00:37:44,982
the one whom my wife bore,
the one who isn't mine.

405
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:49,339
My wife's, yet not mine.

406
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:54,5
Rita looks good in that photo,
doesn't she?

407
00:37:54,278 --> 00:37:57,863
But Ma, why do you work so hard?
This is why you fall ill.

408
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,398
I'm not going to let you work
anymore, you understand?

409
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:04,904
You mad boy! If I don't work,
how are we going to eat?

410
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:07,110
I'm a man. I'm the one
who is going to work.

411
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:09,277
From tomorrow, no going to school!

412
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:13,27
You won't go to school?
Won't you?

413
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:16,132
How will you become a gentleman,
unless you educate yourself?

414
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,215
You want to be a vagabond!
- Mother!

415
00:38:20,7 --> 00:38:25,90
Without schooling, how can you become
a lawyer, a magistrate, a judge?

416
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:33,548
If you say so, I'll go to school
...and I'll work too.

417
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:38,9
But I won't become a judge.
At Rita's I met a judge.

418
00:38:38,90 --> 00:38:39,556
I didn't like him.

419
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,567
"Go for a stroll, those
who are going."

420
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:14,937
"Go for a stroll, those
who are going."

421
00:39:15,17 --> 00:39:18,365
"Since when we have been waiting,

422
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:21,602
we cobblers."

423
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:25,383
Page 120.

424
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:29,674
Raj.

425
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:32,562
Good morning, teacher.
Sorry, I'm late.

426
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:36,216
I work, you know. I work
- What's all this?

427
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,633
Brush, wax... I give you a good polish.

428
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:44,424
Your name has been struck
from the rolls.

429
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,924
What?
- You can't study here anymore.

430
00:39:47,5 --> 00:39:51,878
But I've brought the fees too! If you
say so, I'll stop polishing boots.

431
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:53,758
Silence!

432
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:03,942
So I can't study here any longer, can I?

433
00:40:04,22 --> 00:40:05,174
No.

434
00:40:06,361 --> 00:40:12,299
For a minute, can I talk to Rita?
I have a gift for her.

435
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:17,818
Rita's father has transferred her
out of this school. They have moved.

436
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:30,928
Why did you kick my ball?

437
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:33,634
Forgive me, I stepped on it by mistake.

438
00:40:33,714 --> 00:40:36,970
How dare a boot-polish-boy?
- Hit him!

439
00:40:38,69 --> 00:40:40,553
Beat him! Beat him!

440
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:44,53
You're just a boot-polish boy.
You dare take me on?

441
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:46,845
Beat him! Beat him!

442
00:40:46,925 --> 00:40:48,345
Hit him!

443
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:53,428
His coat... strip him!

444
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:56,428
Hit him!

445
00:40:56,928 --> 00:40:59,636
Beat him! Beat him!

446
00:41:01,8 --> 00:41:03,136
Beat him! Beat him!

447
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,220
Beat him! Beat him!

448
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:10,428
My Ma is ill.
Let me go to my Ma.

449
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:14,137
You can hit me some other time.
My Ma is ill. Let me go to my Ma.

450
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:16,348
Your Ma is ill?
- Yes

451
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:18,610
His Ma is ill!

452
00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:23,12
Run! Uncle Jagga is here! Run!

453
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:26,136
Run! Uncle Jagga is here! Run!

454
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:50,57
Get up. Come with me.

455
00:41:55,588 --> 00:41:57,754
Where to?
- Wherever I go.

456
00:41:58,113 --> 00:42:00,462
From now on, you go wherever I go.

457
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:03,712
That's what your father wanted.

458
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,4
You know my father?
- Yes.

459
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:09,421
I knew him.

460
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,248
Whatever I am today,
is all thanks to him.

461
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,4
I owe your Dad an old debt.

462
00:42:21,593 --> 00:42:23,687
Then you'll surely help me
find a job somewhere?

463
00:42:23,768 --> 00:42:27,44
Job? What job?
- Whatever! I'll do anything!

464
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,166
My Ma is sick! We haven't anything
to eat! Give me any job!

465
00:42:31,246 --> 00:42:34,183
I'll clean the dishes, sweep floors,
carry luggage... I'll do anything!

466
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,294
Just give me a job! Give me a job!

467
00:42:38,663 --> 00:42:41,305
You fool! Only fools work.

468
00:42:41,637 --> 00:42:44,565
You're a smart boy.
And you talk of working?

469
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,764
Unless I work, how will I eat?
How will I feed my mother?

470
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:50,680
Steal
- Steal?

471
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:03,221
Stealing... no!

472
00:43:13,555 --> 00:43:17,346
Yes, yes, yes!
Steal! Steal! Steal!

473
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:21,26
Pick pockets, locks, rob, kill.

474
00:43:32,555 --> 00:43:34,138
Raj!

475
00:43:38,23 --> 00:43:38,848
Raj!

476
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:40,701
Raj!

477
00:43:44,56 --> 00:43:45,109
Raj!

478
00:43:45,972 --> 00:43:47,647
You took so long, son.

479
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,764
You've been hungry all day.
Go on, eat food.

480
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:57,545
Food? Have you cooked?
- Yes, why not?

481
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,264
It's over there, under the plate.

482
00:44:01,4 --> 00:44:04,346
The bread is warm.
I even cooked potatoes.

483
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:07,476
Take some. It's on the shelf.

484
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:21,389
Have you found it?

485
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,555
Yes Ma, I found it.

486
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,906
The bread, and potatoes too.

487
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:37,865
The potatoes are delicious.

488
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:44,573
Eat it then. Give me a bread too.
I'm very hungry.

489
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:47,990
Very hungry.
- Bread?

490
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:52,74
Yes, Ma. I'll get it right now.

491
00:44:53,947 --> 00:44:55,282
Right now.

492
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:03,699
Yes, yes, yes!
Steal! Steal! Steal!

493
00:45:04,129 --> 00:45:06,846
Pick pockets, locks, rob, kill.

494
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,410
You thief!

495
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,861
Stealing bread?
- Excuse me, my Ma is hungry.

496
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:34,782
She hasn't had anything to eat
in three days

497
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,574
Son of a gun! Off you go to the cops!

498
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:46,490
What's your name?
I asked you what's your name?

499
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:48,247
Raj!

500
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:49,634
Father's name?

501
00:45:50,183 --> 00:45:52,115
Ma has never told me
my father's name.

502
00:45:52,758 --> 00:45:55,787
Where does your mother live?
I asked you where your mother lives.

503
00:45:56,165 --> 00:45:59,252
I won't tell you. I won't.

504
00:45:59,332 --> 00:46:02,886
If you don't, who pays for your bail?
You'll go to jail. You know that?

505
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:04,31
Jail!

506
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:13,322
Where are you running?
- Don't send me to jail!

507
00:46:13,405 --> 00:46:15,533
My Ma is hungry.
Don't send me to jail!

508
00:46:15,613 --> 00:46:18,113
My Ma is hungry.
Don't send me to jail!

509
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:26,947
Afraid, son? Don't be.
This is just your first step.

510
00:46:28,154 --> 00:46:30,322
The road ahead is very long.

511
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:20,493
Hey, are you mad?

512
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,326
Why are you laughing at your bread?

513
00:47:24,743 --> 00:47:27,743
This bread...

514
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,745
you know this bread?
She makes you dance.

515
00:47:31,826 --> 00:47:34,493
What do you mean?
- She made me dance!

516
00:47:35,273 --> 00:47:39,576
Outside the jail twelve years ago,
had I found her...

517
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:43,201
would I be here time and again,
for her sake?

518
00:47:43,285 --> 00:47:47,410
You've had enough for free.
Come on, the jailer is calling you.

519
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:50,785
Your time's up. Find yourself
some other hotel.

520
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:51,868
Time is over?
- Yes.

521
00:47:51,948 --> 00:47:54,535
Okay, boss! I don't like
the food of this place!

522
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:56,243
Now I will eat in Taj Mahal Hotel.

523
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:59,705
If you want to eat at
the Taj Mahal Hotel, stop thieving.

524
00:47:59,785 --> 00:48:01,993
Yes, boss.
- Stop picking pockets.

525
00:48:02,76 --> 00:48:04,371
Yes, boss.
- And do some honest work.

526
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:06,35
Sure. I'm going on a pilgrimage.

527
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,826
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

528
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:39,422
"In troubled times, I am
the star in the sky."

529
00:48:39,502 --> 00:48:43,910
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

530
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:50,660
"In troubled times,
I am the star in the sky."

531
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,493
"I am a vagabond."

532
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:09,922
"I don't have a house or a family."

533
00:49:10,2 --> 00:49:15,508
"Nobody loves me. Nobody loves me."

534
00:49:18,118 --> 00:49:22,121
"There is no promise of meeting
someone from across."

535
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:27,618
"Nobody loves me. Nobody loves me."

536
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:33,146
"I'm the beloved of isolated
and alien places."

537
00:49:33,226 --> 00:49:37,451
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

538
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:43,996
"In troubled times, I am
the star in the sky."

539
00:49:44,76 --> 00:49:45,762
"I am a vagabond."

540
00:50:02,46 --> 00:50:04,790
"I'm not flourishing,
I am not ruined."

541
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,542
"Still I sing happy songs."

542
00:50:07,623 --> 00:50:11,299
"Still I sing happy songs."

543
00:50:11,661 --> 00:50:14,404
"My heart is filled with wounds."

544
00:50:14,484 --> 00:50:17,343
"But still these lively eyes smile."

545
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:25,701
"World.."

546
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:33,243
"World, I am troubled by your
sorrows or misfortunes."

547
00:50:35,43 --> 00:50:39,493
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

548
00:50:40,497 --> 00:50:45,941
"In troubled times, I am
the star in the sky."

549
00:50:46,21 --> 00:50:50,604
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

550
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:53,285
"I am a vagabond."

551
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:20,895
Hands up!

552
00:51:24,277 --> 00:51:26,132
Raj! Raj!

553
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,424
Raj! You had me scared.

554
00:51:32,275 --> 00:51:34,465
Come on, give me a hug.

555
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,632
Well boss, how is business?

556
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:44,507
Hey, are you talking English?
- This time in jail...

557
00:51:44,587 --> 00:51:48,715
I came across one of the politicos.
I thought I'd make the most of it.

558
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:50,337
I could use it.

559
00:51:50,418 --> 00:51:53,49
Tell me, what news of Ma?
You told her, didn't you?

560
00:51:53,132 --> 00:51:58,90
Yes, a long time ago. She thinks
you're away on a long business trip...

561
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:04,433
with your boss. When you go home,
you must go home in style.

562
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:08,215
I have it all fixed.
- First, tell me...

563
00:52:08,644 --> 00:52:14,381
have you been sending money to Ma?
- Of course! On the 1st of every month!

564
00:52:14,678 --> 00:52:18,214
Say, you'd need some money,
wouldn't you? Keep this.

565
00:52:21,828 --> 00:52:23,257
Looking for this thing?

566
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,381
I guessed it was for me.
So why not take it for myself?

567
00:52:26,556 --> 00:52:29,278
Want a ten or a twenty? No?

568
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:34,965
Bravo, my boy! You'll make
your guru proud someday.

569
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:47,590
And someday, I'll ask your father what
the gentleman's son grows up to be.

570
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,132
Mother!

571
00:52:54,147 --> 00:52:58,132
Hello, mummy darling! Hello!
- Raj! Raj!

572
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:06,965
Raj, I've been dying to see you!
This time, it has been a whole year!

573
00:53:07,738 --> 00:53:09,997
Where has this boss of yours
been taking you to?

574
00:53:10,80 --> 00:53:13,247
This time, I've been
to London and more.

575
00:53:13,327 --> 00:53:14,580
London?

576
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:20,573
London, France, Paris,
New York, America.

577
00:53:20,653 --> 00:53:23,247
On my way back, I even stopped
at Arthur Road.

578
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:27,663
My boss is into import and export.
- What's that?

579
00:53:29,363 --> 00:53:33,455
You don't know import-export?
You're so naive.

580
00:53:34,106 --> 00:53:37,205
Your son is about to become a big
businessman, and you don't know...

581
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:41,247
what import-export is?
Listen to this, Ma.

582
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:48,705
Import-export means moving the money
between here and there.

583
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:53,247
But mostly, it comes in this way.

584
00:53:53,925 --> 00:53:57,330
How would I know?
You've even started talking English.

585
00:53:57,805 --> 00:54:00,538
Sit, I'll get tea for you.

586
00:54:28,136 --> 00:54:29,593
What are you looking at?

587
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:33,77
I'm a thief.

588
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:35,583
A lying thief.

589
00:54:37,498 --> 00:54:39,118
I've sinned.

590
00:54:45,472 --> 00:54:47,577
Why did you turn that photo over?

591
00:54:50,672 --> 00:54:55,822
Whenever I look at it...

592
00:54:57,45 --> 00:54:59,118
she seems to be staring at me.

593
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:02,160
She brings back childhood memories.
Why don't you admit that?

594
00:55:03,882 --> 00:55:07,823
Where could she be now?
Why don't you try to locate her?

595
00:55:11,914 --> 00:55:15,243
Childhood days, and childhood friends
...do they ever come back, Ma?

596
00:55:17,175 --> 00:55:19,92
I'm going out.
- But your tea?

597
00:55:19,247 --> 00:55:21,424
Forget it. I've got to see a friend.

598
00:55:22,338 --> 00:55:24,342
My son he is! Silly boy!

599
00:56:00,812 --> 00:56:03,937
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

600
00:56:04,17 --> 00:56:08,24
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

601
00:56:08,104 --> 00:56:11,857
"Meeting covertly at night is
considered as sin by others."

602
00:56:11,937 --> 00:56:12,768
"Sin."

603
00:56:12,848 --> 00:56:15,982
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

604
00:56:16,62 --> 00:56:19,729
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

605
00:56:42,562 --> 00:56:46,270
"This is salacious youth."

606
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:53,604
"This is salacious youth."

607
00:56:53,867 --> 00:56:57,271
"It is crazy for you."

608
00:57:08,832 --> 00:57:12,20
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

609
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:16,62
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

610
00:57:36,485 --> 00:57:40,30
"Why do you reject me?"

611
00:57:43,943 --> 00:57:47,437
"Why do you reject me?"

612
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:51,218
"Why don't you look in my eyes?"

613
00:57:51,456 --> 00:57:55,152
"Rob, the world is yours."

614
00:57:55,232 --> 00:57:58,864
"Rob, the world is yours."

615
00:57:58,944 --> 00:58:02,402
"Why are you afraid of love?"

616
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:05,841
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

617
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:09,854
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

618
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,608
How much did you make today?
- Ten thousand five hundred.

619
00:58:36,483 --> 00:58:37,900
Fifty-Fifty.

620
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:46,775
Why only fifty-fifty?
You can have many times more.

621
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,275
How?
- Tomorrow morning...

622
00:58:49,355 --> 00:58:53,191
a bank is being inaugurated.
Say, how's the opportunity?

623
00:58:53,271 --> 00:58:55,986
A sleight of hand, and there's
a hundred thousand or so going.

624
00:58:56,66 --> 00:58:58,361
All you need is a car.
- Car?

625
00:58:58,441 --> 00:59:02,531
A good car.
- For me, that's a sleight of hand.

626
00:59:02,612 --> 00:59:05,775
Eleven tomorrow. - Where?
- I'll tell you where.

627
00:59:06,192 --> 00:59:07,483
Okay, boss.

628
00:59:08,101 --> 00:59:11,108
Good! Someday,
you'll surely make me proud.

629
00:59:25,9 --> 00:59:26,654
It's late.

630
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:29,47
You have to make it by eleven.

631
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:31,977
First class car!

632
00:59:32,928 --> 00:59:35,598
Car? Where?
- Out there

633
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,572
Who's driving it?
- No idea.

634
00:59:38,652 --> 00:59:41,57
A girl just got down
and walked into that shop.

635
00:59:41,226 --> 00:59:43,432
Keys?
- With her, maybe.

636
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:48,425
That one?
- Yes.

637
01:00:03,211 --> 01:00:05,314
Idiot! Can't you see?

638
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:12,378
Found it?

639
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,9
No keys here.
- Then?

640
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:20,983
Return the bag.
- What for?

641
01:00:21,229 --> 01:00:24,553
It will make things easier.
We'll make it work.

642
01:00:24,634 --> 01:00:26,15
How will you return it?

643
01:00:30,344 --> 01:00:32,411
What happened?
- I've been robbed!

644
01:00:32,491 --> 01:00:34,67
Who did it?
- I didn't notice.

645
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:36,360
He was with you!

646
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,231
I had it a moment ago
- You didn't notice who robbed you?

647
01:00:40,564 --> 01:00:42,564
Had I noticed, I would've caught him!

648
01:00:43,997 --> 01:00:45,377
You...

649
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:47,647
Yes you!
- Who me?

650
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:51,147
Look, there goes the thief!
Stop! Thief!

651
01:01:02,384 --> 01:01:04,151
He jumped over the wall!

652
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:05,682
Wait here

653
01:01:08,858 --> 01:01:10,349
Come on, help me.

654
01:01:17,524 --> 01:01:21,266
There you are! Hiding!

655
01:01:27,35 --> 01:01:30,178
Aren't you ashamed? Give it to me.
Else, I'll beat you to pulp.

656
01:01:30,507 --> 01:01:33,178
I'm going to kill you! Give me!

657
01:01:33,262 --> 01:01:35,982
Where are you running away?

658
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:42,511
Give the purse!

659
01:01:46,794 --> 01:01:50,848
You dare stare at me like that?

660
01:01:51,227 --> 01:01:53,805
Hey... knife!

661
01:02:06,21 --> 01:02:08,29
Are you running away? Coward!

662
01:02:09,29 --> 01:02:10,279
Coward!

663
01:02:11,696 --> 01:02:14,187
Scoundrel!

664
01:02:18,64 --> 01:02:19,457
He ran away

665
01:02:21,75 --> 01:02:23,696
Anyway, here's your purse"

666
01:02:24,531 --> 01:02:26,29
Keep it.

667
01:02:26,546 --> 01:02:28,736
You've been through so much
trouble for my sake.

668
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:36,696
No trouble. I've taken more.

669
01:02:37,323 --> 01:02:42,529
I should apologise. You risked
your life to get my purse back.

670
01:02:43,654 --> 01:02:48,237
And I suspected you.
- Not your fault.

671
01:02:48,785 --> 01:02:50,362
It's just my looks.

672
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:52,737
Sometimes even the police
are mistaken.

673
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,29
Bye

674
01:02:57,414 --> 01:03:00,817
How was the show?
- No use.

675
01:03:00,897 --> 01:03:03,696
We'll find a car. Why worry?
Get over to the place.

676
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:06,663
I'll join you after a change
of clothes.

677
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:11,170
Hey Romeo! You tear your clothes
no sooner than you see a girl!

678
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,708
Get lost.
- Get going.

679
01:03:34,915 --> 01:03:38,729
Stop! Thief!

680
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,902
Where are you going?

681
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,819
Inside.

682
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:40,495
Inside? What do you want?
- Strange question.

683
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,831
Your boss is the one who called me.
And you ask me what I want?

684
01:04:43,911 --> 01:04:46,78
The boss, or the lady? Who called you?

685
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,161
Yes, the lady.

686
01:04:48,245 --> 01:04:50,620
So you're the one
who fixes the piano?

687
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,846
Yes! The piano fixer!

688
01:04:55,661 --> 01:04:57,36
Is the piano in there?
- Are pianos kept outside?

689
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,828
No! Inside. Come on in,
else I'll get into trouble.

690
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,542
Looks like a billionaire's palace!

691
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:36,332
Hello, darling.
- What did you say?

692
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:46,127
The mantle!

693
01:05:47,772 --> 01:05:50,919
What a lovely mantle!

694
01:05:51,524 --> 01:05:53,377
What a grand mansion!

695
01:05:57,802 --> 01:05:58,661
The mantle!

696
01:06:00,55 --> 01:06:02,836
What kind of a joke is this?
Here's the piano.

697
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:09,279
This piano is in bad shape.
Badly damaged.

698
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,187
Look.

699
01:06:11,974 --> 01:06:16,197
Rotten! It'll take me time to fix it.
Go on, get back to work.

700
01:06:17,415 --> 01:06:18,601
I'll fix it.

701
01:06:41,696 --> 01:06:43,209
Who's playing my piano?

702
01:06:47,415 --> 01:06:49,220
You?
- You!

703
01:06:58,999 --> 01:07:03,332
I'm mistaken, once again
I thought it must be a thief.

704
01:07:04,52 --> 01:07:05,811
That's what I am.
- What?

705
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,752
I mean, who else but a thief
would come in uninvited?

706
01:07:09,832 --> 01:07:12,499
No, it's good of you to have come.

707
01:07:12,981 --> 01:07:17,10
You did me a favour.
I should've called you over.

708
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:21,833
But I didn't know your address.
How did you find out my address?

709
01:07:22,473 --> 01:07:25,41
What?
- How did you find out my address?

710
01:07:27,505 --> 01:07:29,916
No, don't ask me that.
It's a secret.

711
01:07:30,691 --> 01:07:33,504
Let's say, it's luck that has led me
to your doorstep.

712
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:36,152
Please be seated
- Thanks.

713
01:07:49,77 --> 01:07:50,799
Cigarette?

714
01:07:52,729 --> 01:07:54,256
Lighter?

715
01:07:54,925 --> 01:07:57,340
No, thanks. Matches.

716
01:07:58,104 --> 01:08:01,89
Madam, he's the piano-fixer...
- Piano fixer?

717
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:03,757
Your servant thinks I'm here
to fix the piano.

718
01:08:03,837 --> 01:08:09,7
But you said...
- Never mind, take the call. Go on.

719
01:08:10,768 --> 01:08:14,210
Strange fellow.
He took you for a piano mechanic.

720
01:08:15,594 --> 01:08:19,2
Not his fault.
It's just my looks.

721
01:08:19,622 --> 01:08:22,281
Inspector sahib, no thief came in here.

722
01:08:22,362 --> 01:08:24,44
Please wait here.

723
01:08:24,127 --> 01:08:25,419
Inspector?

724
01:08:26,397 --> 01:08:30,210
What brings the police here?
Excuse me, I'll be back.

725
01:08:31,809 --> 01:08:37,835
A car thief has sneaked into one
of the houses in this neighbourhood.

726
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:42,960
Have you seen anyone?
- No, no one came in here.

727
01:08:43,781 --> 01:08:46,960
She's wrong about
no one coming in here.

728
01:08:48,585 --> 01:08:51,377
I happen to be a visitor.
Would you be looking for me?

729
01:08:51,743 --> 01:08:53,710
No... how could this be?

730
01:08:54,252 --> 01:08:55,960
Okay. Forgive me.

731
01:08:58,676 --> 01:08:59,960
Come.

732
01:09:02,381 --> 01:09:05,777
Grand house.
- Yes. It belongs to the Judge.

733
01:09:05,857 --> 01:09:08,649
Judge?
- Yes, he's my guardian.

734
01:09:09,112 --> 01:09:10,399
Guardian?

735
01:09:10,836 --> 01:09:13,985
Like the guard on the train
...signalling red and green?

736
01:09:14,64 --> 01:09:17,648
No. After my father passed away,
I have been his ward.

737
01:09:18,202 --> 01:09:20,774
For the sake of my education,
he left Lucknow and he came to Bombay.

738
01:09:21,404 --> 01:09:22,925
I am much obliged to him.

739
01:09:24,889 --> 01:09:29,452
Do judges sport such grand houses?
He must be making a pile on the side.

740
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:32,296
What a thing to say!
The judge is very principled.

741
01:09:32,761 --> 01:09:37,168
He never spares criminals.
- I hope God spares him!

742
01:09:38,76 --> 01:09:44,212
Not to worry. If you're ever arraigned
in his court, let me defend your case.

743
01:09:45,437 --> 01:09:47,212
You... lawyer?
- Yes.

744
01:09:51,553 --> 01:09:54,87
I took you for a schoolgirl.

745
01:09:55,353 --> 01:09:58,629
That was a nice one. A couple
of months, and I'll be an advocate.

746
01:09:58,953 --> 01:10:00,504
Would you like to see my degree?

747
01:10:02,454 --> 01:10:08,267
A judge lives here. And a lawyer too.
Leaves only one to make a full court!

748
01:10:08,347 --> 01:10:11,129
Yours truly. And here I am.
- And what are you up to?

749
01:10:11,452 --> 01:10:12,904
I steal.

750
01:10:12,984 --> 01:10:16,282
Stealing, picking pockets, locks,
ladies' purses, like yours...

751
01:10:16,362 --> 01:10:19,296
that's what I'm up to.
- You're joking again. Be seated.

752
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,104
You don't think I'm a thief?
- No, I think you're a gentleman.

753
01:10:24,184 --> 01:10:26,684
This is the new world order!

754
01:10:27,84 --> 01:10:31,334
The thieves, the hoodwinkers, they
all dress in first class suits like...

755
01:10:31,414 --> 01:10:34,686
...I'm wearing and
we take them for gentlemen.

756
01:10:34,766 --> 01:10:39,603
But those who work hard for an
honest living and dress shabbily...

757
01:10:39,684 --> 01:10:45,268
...are labelled tramps and wastrels.
The capitalists, the blackmarketeers...

758
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:49,268
the profiteers, the usurers...
who are they? Thieves, like I am!

759
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:53,768
You sound like a stock broker
or a banker.

760
01:10:55,89 --> 01:10:57,516
You might say that give and take
of money is what I'm concerned with.

761
01:10:57,596 --> 01:10:59,976
As far as banks are concerned,
I visit banks regularly.

762
01:11:00,992 --> 01:11:02,18
Be seated.

763
01:11:04,476 --> 01:11:06,518
Tell me your name.

764
01:11:21,756 --> 01:11:25,324
Tell me, whose photo is this?
- Mine.

765
01:11:32,165 --> 01:11:35,921
You?
- Yes, when I was young.

766
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:38,382
It's a birthday photo.

767
01:11:39,526 --> 01:11:43,40
Your name?
- Rita. Why?

768
01:11:50,329 --> 01:11:53,995
Ms Rita, would you like to come
to my house?

769
01:11:55,476 --> 01:11:57,882
I'd like to show you
something unique.

770
01:11:59,531 --> 01:12:03,401
My mother would be very pleased
to meet you. Come

771
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:15,430
Raj!

772
01:12:16,784 --> 01:12:18,97
Rita!

773
01:12:18,526 --> 01:12:22,847
You?
- After twelve years.

774
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,222
You've changed!

775
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,513
You haven't changed at all.

776
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:40,431
Where have you been, Raj?

777
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:43,885
Looking for you.

778
01:12:45,781 --> 01:12:48,586
And at last, I've found you
- And when I saw you...

779
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:50,697
I took you for a thief.

780
01:12:52,26 --> 01:12:56,156
Not your fault.
It's in my looks.

781
01:12:57,867 --> 01:12:59,73
Raj!

782
01:13:44,797 --> 01:13:51,137
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

783
01:13:51,418 --> 01:13:58,68
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

784
01:14:08,589 --> 01:14:12,631
"The heart had spoken to a heart."

785
01:14:12,918 --> 01:14:16,929
"The heart had spoken to a heart."

786
01:14:17,176 --> 01:14:20,995
"The old times have come back."

787
01:14:21,75 --> 01:14:25,380
"The old times have come back."

788
01:14:25,792 --> 01:14:31,756
"He brought the happiness with
him, my heart flutters."

789
01:14:31,836 --> 01:14:38,339
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

790
01:14:48,801 --> 01:14:52,839
"From the eyes, he dwelled
in my heart."

791
01:14:53,136 --> 01:14:57,89
"From the eyes, he dwelled
in my heart."

792
01:14:57,355 --> 01:15:01,175
"I smile and scatter the stars."

793
01:15:01,256 --> 01:15:05,297
"I smile and scatter the stars."

794
01:15:05,819 --> 01:15:11,713
"Feelings dance and sing,
my heart flutters."

795
01:15:12,6 --> 01:15:18,422
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

796
01:15:29,5 --> 01:15:33,80
"The days belong to us
and love is young."

797
01:15:33,298 --> 01:15:37,175
"The days belong to us
and love is young."

798
01:15:37,689 --> 01:15:41,464
"My world is flourishing
due to him."

799
01:15:41,544 --> 01:15:45,589
"My world is flourishing
due to him."

800
01:15:46,6 --> 01:15:52,211
"The thief returned to my heart,
my heart flutters."

801
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:58,502
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

802
01:15:58,783 --> 01:16:05,3
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

803
01:16:06,138 --> 01:16:07,839
The Judge is here.

804
01:16:10,552 --> 01:16:12,547
So here you are. And you're late.

805
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:17,329
The doctor has told you to come home
and rest for at least an hour.

806
01:16:18,94 --> 01:16:21,323
But you won't listen.
You look so tired.

807
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,465
Hello, Rita.
- Hello, Rita!

808
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:26,212
Just sit here. I'll get you
your dressing gown.

809
01:16:28,754 --> 01:16:30,837
Tell me, where have you been
all this time?

810
01:16:31,427 --> 01:16:35,337
I had a lecture in the law college.
I went there directly from the court.

811
01:16:36,599 --> 01:16:38,462
All that jabbering
is giving me a headache.

812
01:16:40,795 --> 01:16:44,920
That's bound to happen. The doctor
told you to eat before eight.

813
01:16:46,277 --> 01:16:47,712
It's nine thirty now.

814
01:16:50,587 --> 01:16:52,712
Listen to that!
Even the clock is angry with you.

815
01:16:56,829 --> 01:16:58,129
Come on.

816
01:17:17,564 --> 01:17:21,295
Tell me about yourself. What have
you been up to all evening?

817
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:27,545
You look as if you've found
a treasure.

818
01:17:29,362 --> 01:17:32,837
You could say that. A long-lost friend
is no less than a treasure.

819
01:17:33,545 --> 01:17:36,670
You'll be glad when you meet Raj.
You're certain to like him!

820
01:17:44,337 --> 01:17:51,629
Who is this Mr. Raj? Where does he live?
What does he do? What's his family name?

821
01:17:52,171 --> 01:17:55,837
He's a childhood friend.
We were in school together.

822
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:58,837
I'm seeing him after twelve years!

823
01:17:59,912 --> 01:18:01,504
After twelve years?

824
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,712
After so many years,
most people change.

825
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:09,920
Raj has changed too. At school,
he used to be very quiet.

826
01:18:10,293 --> 01:18:13,379
Now he has great sense of humour.
When I asked him what he's up to...

827
01:18:13,635 --> 01:18:15,504
he said he's a thief.

828
01:18:16,795 --> 01:18:21,170
Maybe that wasn't a joke?
- I don't follow you.

829
01:18:21,754 --> 01:18:23,295
Never mind.

830
01:18:24,545 --> 01:18:26,545
You know what young men
are like, these days.

831
01:18:27,676 --> 01:18:32,4
Who knows, they might steal
something valuable.

832
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:08,530
The water is deep.
You might drown.

833
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:15,709
Not without you
- Is that so? Try that.

834
01:20:17,566 --> 01:20:18,834
Is that so?

835
01:20:37,766 --> 01:20:40,44
Hey lady, haven't you finished
dressing yet?

836
01:20:40,124 --> 01:20:44,126
Where are you headed?
Gentlemen don't barge in...

837
01:20:44,387 --> 01:20:47,959
when ladies are changing dresses.
Don't you know that?

838
01:20:48,751 --> 01:20:50,751
How would I know?

839
01:20:58,793 --> 01:21:04,584
I'm no gentleman.
- Savage.

840
01:21:07,221 --> 01:21:08,543
Savage.

841
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,793
I'm not about to give in
to your type.

842
01:21:17,418 --> 01:21:19,128
Where are you running away?

843
01:21:20,843 --> 01:21:23,668
Let go of my hand. What kind
of a stupid joke is this?

844
01:21:25,5 --> 01:21:26,126
You savage!

845
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:28,670
Am I?
- Yes! You're a savage!

846
01:21:29,157 --> 01:21:31,584
Savage?
I'm a penniless, uneducated tramp!

847
01:21:32,562 --> 01:21:34,784
I don't fit into high society!

848
01:21:34,864 --> 01:21:37,375
How dare I maul your fragile body
with my beastly hands.

849
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:39,671
I told Ma that childhood friends,
like childhood days are gone...

850
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:41,543
never to return.

851
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:45,126
Good of you to have told me my class.

852
01:21:47,787 --> 01:21:49,376
It was a joke. Don't get angry.

853
01:21:51,228 --> 01:21:54,587
You want to hit me? Go ahead.

854
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:04,34
Whom will I hit?

855
01:22:06,15 --> 01:22:07,325
You?

856
01:22:08,648 --> 01:22:10,38
Or myself?

857
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:43,945
Hey! Hey!

858
01:22:45,819 --> 01:22:47,24
Are you happy?

859
01:22:48,836 --> 01:22:50,297
No.

860
01:22:51,907 --> 01:22:55,216
Where are you lost?
- Up there

861
01:22:56,685 --> 01:22:59,254
Come back.
- Where to?

862
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:04,305
Beside me.
- Why?

863
01:23:05,378 --> 01:23:06,929
No reason.

864
01:23:16,232 --> 01:23:17,930
Aren't you ashamed?

865
01:23:22,172 --> 01:23:24,992
What are you looking at?
The Moon?

866
01:23:27,883 --> 01:23:30,367
No. Clouds.

867
01:23:32,308 --> 01:23:35,38
What's your problem?
You don't see the Moon...

868
01:23:35,118 --> 01:23:38,118
and you see the dark clouds?
Won't you tell me?

869
01:23:40,868 --> 01:23:42,826
Who else can I tell?

870
01:23:44,695 --> 01:23:46,242
Rita.
- Yes.

871
01:23:47,618 --> 01:23:49,631
We're seeing each other
after twelve years.

872
01:23:50,45 --> 01:23:51,368
So what?

873
01:23:52,385 --> 01:23:56,951
A lot changes in twelve years.
- The Judge said that too!

874
01:23:57,268 --> 01:24:01,243
But I don't agree. Look at us.
We're still friends.

875
01:24:02,79 --> 01:24:07,785
The Judge is right.
You know nothing about me.

876
01:24:09,285 --> 01:24:10,742
Who I am...

877
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:13,410
My circumstances...

878
01:24:14,484 --> 01:24:16,285
My family background...

879
01:24:17,573 --> 01:24:20,743
What I have been doing...
what I am doing.

880
01:24:22,326 --> 01:24:27,48
You know nothing about me.
- Nor do I want to know.

881
01:24:29,98 --> 01:24:34,160
All I know is that you are
the one I...

882
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:41,492
Rita, you are so nice.
But so naive.

883
01:24:42,338 --> 01:24:45,250
And you're such a fool.
A savage.

884
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:47,910
I'm not talking to you.

885
01:24:49,70 --> 01:24:50,492
Look.

886
01:24:52,43 --> 01:24:53,451
The clouds?

887
01:24:55,113 --> 01:24:56,910
They are moving away from my Moon.

888
01:24:59,371 --> 01:25:01,118
You know, today's my birthday.

889
01:25:03,58 --> 01:25:06,761
Which? Tenth? Eleventh?

890
01:25:07,69 --> 01:25:08,910
You don't ask a lady that.

891
01:25:09,577 --> 01:25:11,493
All right, I'll whisper it to you.

892
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:13,867
Twenty one.

893
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,992
No! It's looking at us.

894
01:25:17,918 --> 01:25:19,492
What?
- That!

895
01:25:23,638 --> 01:25:29,451
"Turn your face away for a moment."

896
01:25:36,712 --> 01:25:47,902
"Turn your face away for a moment,
O moon."

897
01:25:47,982 --> 01:25:52,90
"I will love him."

898
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:55,972
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

899
01:25:56,52 --> 01:26:03,634
"Turn your face away for a moment,
O moon."

900
01:26:03,719 --> 01:26:07,555
"I will love him."

901
01:26:07,635 --> 01:26:11,385
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

902
01:26:24,437 --> 01:26:28,510
"The heart worships love."

903
01:26:32,3 --> 01:26:35,719
"The heart worships love."

904
01:26:35,892 --> 01:26:40,164
"And even I am with him."

905
01:26:40,244 --> 01:26:44,52
"The stars look at
the moon everyday..

906
01:26:44,135 --> 01:26:47,747
..but this is my first night."

907
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:51,14
"My first night."

908
01:26:51,94 --> 01:26:58,597
"Go and hide in the clouds, O moon."

909
01:26:58,677 --> 01:27:02,347
"I will love him."

910
01:27:02,427 --> 01:27:06,54
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

911
01:27:06,135 --> 01:27:10,10
"Turn your face here for a moment."

912
01:27:13,747 --> 01:27:21,10
"Turn your face here for a moment,
O moon."

913
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:24,889
"I will love her."

914
01:27:24,969 --> 01:27:28,816
"I will lock eyes with her."

915
01:27:41,885 --> 01:27:45,635
"I am a thief, my work is to steal."

916
01:27:49,466 --> 01:27:53,94
"I am a thief, my work is to steal."

917
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:57,472
"I have a bad name in the world."

918
01:27:57,552 --> 01:28:05,97
"I have been stealing hearts,
this is my work."

919
01:28:05,177 --> 01:28:08,389
"This is my work."

920
01:28:08,469 --> 01:28:15,805
"You come as a witness, O moon."

921
01:28:15,885 --> 01:28:19,514
"I will love her."

922
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:23,177
"I will lock eyes with her."

923
01:28:36,903 --> 01:28:41,344
"Don't get lost after
stealing my heart."

924
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:48,294
"Don't get lost after
stealing my heart."

925
01:28:48,374 --> 01:28:52,96
"Don't forget the path."

926
01:28:52,176 --> 01:28:59,547
"Under these feet don't crush,
the flower of my heart."

927
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:02,796
"The flower of my heart."

928
01:29:02,876 --> 01:29:10,222
"Explain this to him, O moon."

929
01:29:10,302 --> 01:29:14,56
"I will love him."

930
01:29:14,136 --> 01:29:17,509
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

931
01:29:17,822 --> 01:29:24,969
"Turn your face here for a moment,
O moon."

932
01:29:25,315 --> 01:29:28,885
"I will love her."

933
01:29:28,966 --> 01:29:32,792
"I will lock eyes with her."

934
01:29:33,575 --> 01:29:40,385
"Turn your face away for a moment."

935
01:29:51,815 --> 01:29:54,397
One step more, and the boat
will turn over and sink.

936
01:29:55,565 --> 01:29:56,815
So what?

937
01:30:00,568 --> 01:30:01,881
Let the boat sink.

938
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:16,271
Rita!

939
01:30:16,351 --> 01:30:17,94
Yes.

940
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:20,32
Judge sir!

941
01:30:32,989 --> 01:30:35,139
I don't want it
- But the doctor says...

942
01:30:36,99 --> 01:30:38,8
I should eat by eight.

943
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:56,323
Tonight, it's my turn
to be admonished by the clock.

944
01:31:06,557 --> 01:31:08,115
You are angry with me, aren't you?

945
01:31:17,291 --> 01:31:19,789
Today I was...

946
01:31:19,869 --> 01:31:21,982
With Raj?
- Raj is no stranger.

947
01:31:22,245 --> 01:31:23,767
He's a childhood friend.

948
01:31:28,914 --> 01:31:30,128
I..

949
01:31:31,421 --> 01:31:32,547
I..

950
01:31:33,873 --> 01:31:37,826
I made a promise
to your dying father.

951
01:31:38,915 --> 01:31:41,123
To take care of you
as long as I live.

952
01:31:42,329 --> 01:31:44,456
You must make a promise.

953
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:49,831
If someone likes you,
if you like someone...

954
01:31:51,583 --> 01:31:53,998
...you will not give your consent
without telling me.

955
01:31:54,294 --> 01:31:57,998
I know, I am much obliged to you.

956
01:31:59,206 --> 01:32:01,790
But it doesn't mean that
you can, time and again...

957
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:37,75
Boss?

958
01:32:38,623 --> 01:32:41,748
Recognise me?
Thank you very much!

959
01:32:42,733 --> 01:32:45,310
You haven't much time nowadays.

960
01:32:46,623 --> 01:32:50,253
Well son, are you falling in love?

961
01:32:50,748 --> 01:32:54,159
Or, have you given up your profession
for fear of going to jail?

962
01:32:56,692 --> 01:32:59,567
You don't know the size of the scam
I've planned for you.

963
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,650
She's an heiress.
Just wait for a few days.

964
01:33:05,775 --> 01:33:08,775
I'm angling for a diamond necklace.
- Bravo!

965
01:33:09,577 --> 01:33:13,900
I knew it! You aren't the type
to waste your time.

966
01:33:15,734 --> 01:33:17,380
But remember!

967
01:33:19,42 --> 01:33:24,400
If you try to cheat Jagga...

968
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:51,952
'Nor do I want to know. All I know
is that you are the one I...'

969
01:33:53,799 --> 01:33:54,882
'Really?'

970
01:33:55,359 --> 01:34:02,379
'Remember! If you try
to cheat Jagga...'

971
01:36:33,698 --> 01:36:39,531
"Without you this moonlight
is like fire."

972
01:36:39,614 --> 01:36:42,614
"Do come."

973
01:36:42,698 --> 01:36:46,89
"Do come."

974
01:36:46,169 --> 01:36:51,870
"Without you this moonlight
is like fire."

975
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:54,951
"Do come."

976
01:36:55,31 --> 01:36:58,193
"Do come."

977
01:36:58,599 --> 01:37:03,868
"The flute is not melodious
without you."

978
01:37:03,948 --> 01:37:10,457
"This life of mine is
a melody of pain."

979
01:37:10,537 --> 01:37:13,571
"Do come."

980
01:37:13,651 --> 01:37:17,144
"Do come."

981
01:37:28,765 --> 01:37:31,781
"Do come."

982
01:37:31,861 --> 01:37:34,985
"Do come."

983
01:37:35,65 --> 01:37:38,34
"Do come."

984
01:37:38,114 --> 01:37:40,781
"Do come."

985
01:38:13,263 --> 01:38:16,482
"This is not life,
this is not life."

986
01:38:16,562 --> 01:38:19,721
"This is not life."

987
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:38,660
"I am burning alive in
this fire of life."

988
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:43,35
"The arrows of fire run through me."

989
01:39:01,158 --> 01:39:04,545
"I don't want this hell."

990
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:09,110
"I want the flower, the
love, the friend."

991
01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:12,614
"I want the spring."

992
01:39:12,694 --> 01:39:15,850
"I want the spring."

993
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:19,239
"I want the spring."

994
01:39:19,319 --> 01:39:23,114
"I want the spring."

995
01:39:37,328 --> 01:39:49,781
"Om Namah Shivay."

996
01:39:50,646 --> 01:40:02,786
"Om Namah Shivay."

997
01:40:03,763 --> 01:40:06,693
"Om.."

998
01:40:37,724 --> 01:40:42,724
"My foreigner has returned home."

999
01:40:42,807 --> 01:40:47,932
"The thirst in my eyes is quenched."

1000
01:40:57,724 --> 01:41:02,599
"You are the pearl of my heart."

1001
01:41:07,628 --> 01:41:12,848
"You are the light of my eyes."

1002
01:41:17,463 --> 01:41:22,307
"You are the remembrance
of my childhood."

1003
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:27,148
"My foreigner has returned home."

1004
01:41:37,73 --> 01:41:42,99
"Now don't go away
breaking my heart."

1005
01:41:47,76 --> 01:41:51,807
"Don't leave me crying."

1006
01:41:56,788 --> 01:42:01,723
"You are under the oath of my tears"

1007
01:42:01,807 --> 01:42:06,557
"My foreigner has returned home."

1008
01:43:26,463 --> 01:43:28,788
Rita!

1009
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:36,544
Rita!

1010
01:43:41,872 --> 01:43:43,455
Rita!

1011
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:53,816
Rita!

1012
01:43:57,309 --> 01:44:03,107
Mother! Mother, save me. Mother!
- Raju!

1013
01:44:03,591 --> 01:44:06,442
Ma, I want to be good!

1014
01:44:06,855 --> 01:44:09,669
I promise, I won't have anything to do
with Jagga and those others!

1015
01:44:09,987 --> 01:44:13,938
I'd rather starve than steal.
I will be good.

1016
01:44:14,18 --> 01:44:17,487
People will say I'm honest!
Let's go back to our slum.

1017
01:44:17,827 --> 01:44:22,154
I'll work hard for a living.
I won't steal! Ma, I won't steal!

1018
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:25,987
I want nothing but peace of mind,
and my mother's blessings.

1019
01:44:26,755 --> 01:44:30,125
I won't steal, Ma.
I'll become honest.

1020
01:45:12,926 --> 01:45:13,939
Thank you.

1021
01:45:16,673 --> 01:45:21,18
Yes, sir?
- You're fired. We won't need you.

1022
01:45:22,256 --> 01:45:23,926
What?
- Go away, get out!

1023
01:45:24,6 --> 01:45:25,802
We don't employ thieves.

1024
01:45:26,957 --> 01:45:28,531
As you wish.

1025
01:45:30,739 --> 01:45:36,380
May I ask something, sir? You say
you don't want to employ thieves?

1026
01:45:37,214 --> 01:45:40,381
Would you rather that they keep
thieving all their lives?

1027
01:45:40,961 --> 01:45:42,166
Get out!

1028
01:45:59,339 --> 01:46:00,631
Raj! Raj!

1029
01:46:02,673 --> 01:46:06,536
Fired?
Come on, the boss is calling you.

1030
01:46:08,103 --> 01:46:09,968
Raj, what reply do I carry back
to the boss?

1031
01:46:10,48 --> 01:46:11,630
This..

1032
01:46:15,89 --> 01:46:17,259
He will either steal
or he will starve.

1033
01:46:17,339 --> 01:46:22,240
And how long will he not steal?
He has no way out of crime.

1034
01:46:22,653 --> 01:46:24,369
Let me see how far he goes.

1035
01:46:33,482 --> 01:46:35,681
Where are you going?

1036
01:46:37,468 --> 01:46:40,943
To see Rita.
- You can't go in. The Judge's orders.

1037
01:46:42,807 --> 01:46:44,65
The Judge's orders?

1038
01:46:47,144 --> 01:46:51,930
Then go and tell her that
Raj is waiting out here to see her.

1039
01:46:52,968 --> 01:46:57,769
I have much to tell her.
- She can't see anyone. Get going.

1040
01:47:01,967 --> 01:47:06,865
Get going? Where to?

1041
01:47:21,70 --> 01:47:22,365
Come friend.

1042
01:47:25,317 --> 01:47:27,104
Let me talk to you.

1043
01:47:29,533 --> 01:47:36,869
Strange coincidence, isn't it?
You're a tramp, I'm a tramp too.

1044
01:47:39,234 --> 01:47:43,151
You have no name,
I have no name either.

1045
01:47:46,317 --> 01:47:51,151
You are homeless,
I have no home either.

1046
01:47:53,901 --> 01:47:56,358
Like me, you too crave for love.

1047
01:47:57,942 --> 01:48:01,192
Difference being only that
you are an animal, and I'm human.

1048
01:48:04,105 --> 01:48:05,776
Human.

1049
01:48:11,944 --> 01:48:14,112
I have nothing to give you.

1050
01:48:15,542 --> 01:48:17,302
I can only give love.

1051
01:48:27,458 --> 01:48:30,431
Why don't you watch your step?
Are you blind?

1052
01:48:30,796 --> 01:48:34,22
Mind your tongue.
Bloody savage.

1053
01:48:46,819 --> 01:48:50,111
Savage... am I a savage?

1054
01:48:50,542 --> 01:48:54,921
Am I a mongrel on the streets?
To be kicked at will or whim?

1055
01:49:58,39 --> 01:49:59,304
Piano-fixer?

1056
01:49:59,385 --> 01:50:01,711
Your servant thinks
I'm here to fix the piano.

1057
01:50:12,705 --> 01:50:17,330
"Please come now,
my desires are squirming."

1058
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:22,346
"Please come now,
my desires are squirming."

1059
01:50:22,426 --> 01:50:27,302
"Now the night is about to pass."

1060
01:50:27,382 --> 01:50:32,285
"Now the night is about to pass."

1061
01:50:32,365 --> 01:50:37,285
"I lie crying here,
you are silent there."

1062
01:50:37,368 --> 01:50:42,249
"Now the night is about to pass."

1063
01:50:42,329 --> 01:50:47,201
"Now the night is about to pass."

1064
01:50:55,364 --> 01:51:01,843
"The brightness of the
moon is fading."

1065
01:51:02,196 --> 01:51:11,910
"Even the hearts of stars
are vanishing. Vanishing."

1066
01:51:14,955 --> 01:51:19,580
"The fervent ambiance is painful."

1067
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:24,576
"Now the night is about to pass."

1068
01:51:24,656 --> 01:51:30,181
"Now the night is about to pass."

1069
01:51:39,624 --> 01:51:46,617
"In the palanquin of the moon."

1070
01:51:47,58 --> 01:51:52,36
"In the palanquin of the moon."

1071
01:51:52,116 --> 01:52:01,771
"Where is the bride of night going to?
Where is she going?"

1072
01:52:02,75 --> 01:52:11,677
"Even the fate is about to sleep."

1073
01:52:14,790 --> 01:52:19,441
"You do not arrive,
where will I go?"

1074
01:52:19,521 --> 01:52:24,518
"Now the night is about to pass."

1075
01:52:24,599 --> 01:52:29,489
"Now the night is about to pass."

1076
01:52:29,569 --> 01:52:34,512
"Now the night is about to pass."

1077
01:52:34,592 --> 01:52:39,357
"Now the night is about to pass."

1078
01:52:39,437 --> 01:52:44,274
"Now the night is about to pass."

1079
01:52:44,559 --> 01:52:49,941
"Now the night is about to pass."

1080
01:53:26,135 --> 01:53:27,524
Rita.

1081
01:53:33,235 --> 01:53:34,432
Rita.

1082
01:53:35,523 --> 01:53:36,710
Rita.

1083
01:53:39,124 --> 01:53:42,584
The invitations have been printed.

1084
01:53:44,757 --> 01:53:47,7
The day after tomorrow
is your birthday, isn't it?

1085
01:53:47,965 --> 01:53:51,90
Send them to the friends
you want to invite.

1086
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:55,890
All my friends?

1087
01:54:03,779 --> 01:54:07,737
Yes, all friends. All, who are
worthy of being your friends.

1088
01:54:19,899 --> 01:54:21,857
Your birthday.

1089
01:54:26,506 --> 01:54:29,842
Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?

1090
01:54:30,333 --> 01:54:34,279
I didn't have money to buy anything.
I'll give you some other time.

1091
01:54:34,588 --> 01:54:37,571
Must you only buy something
to make a gift?

1092
01:54:38,757 --> 01:54:40,779
You can give me a flower.

1093
01:54:41,253 --> 01:54:44,486
Someday, I'm going to make
lots of money.

1094
01:54:44,566 --> 01:54:47,946
And I'll buy a gift for you.
Something better than all this.

1095
01:55:03,299 --> 01:55:07,904
Back? I knew someday,
you'd surely come back.

1096
01:55:08,742 --> 01:55:11,696
For you, this is the only door open.

1097
01:55:12,366 --> 01:55:17,904
I need a thousand. A loan
I'll return it after I've earned it.

1098
01:55:19,23 --> 01:55:22,989
Loan? What d'you think I am,
a money-lender?

1099
01:55:23,69 --> 01:55:30,281
Today is Rita's birthday.
Look, she has invited me.

1100
01:55:31,629 --> 01:55:36,87
She takes me for a gentleman.
- So you must dress like a gentleman.

1101
01:55:36,548 --> 01:55:41,4
And to prove yourself, you must
also make a gift to the lady.

1102
01:55:45,423 --> 01:55:50,340
So gentlemanliness is for sale,
and you intend buying some?

1103
01:55:50,421 --> 01:55:55,879
But to become a gentleman, you need
money. One thousand Rupees.

1104
01:55:56,470 --> 01:56:02,546
For that thousand, you have to steal,
rob, or maybe even kill someone for me.

1105
01:56:03,675 --> 01:56:05,754
Do you accept?
- No.

1106
01:56:06,436 --> 01:56:11,346
No! I won't rob!
I won't commit crimes!

1107
01:56:11,426 --> 01:56:13,629
What other way out have you?

1108
01:56:17,47 --> 01:56:22,633
Once a criminal, you can never
become a gentleman again!

1109
01:56:22,713 --> 01:56:25,295
No matter how many times
you change your clothes.

1110
01:56:26,56 --> 01:56:30,879
Crime is written all over your face!
You even tried working.

1111
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:34,247
Not for you, the bread
in the sweat of thy face.

1112
01:56:34,327 --> 01:56:39,629
For you, the only resort
is thieving, crime.

1113
01:56:40,1 --> 01:56:41,324
Same as mine!

1114
01:56:41,782 --> 01:56:43,744
All thanks to your father.

1115
01:57:21,276 --> 01:57:22,692
Watch your step, son.

1116
01:57:24,351 --> 01:57:28,242
I try. But what to do?
Out on the streets...

1117
01:57:28,323 --> 01:57:31,221
...there are those big guns like you.
- Sharp, are you?

1118
01:57:57,942 --> 01:58:00,927
Wow Dewan sir, how nicely you said!

1119
01:58:12,234 --> 01:58:13,589
Have you seen Rita?

1120
01:58:14,776 --> 01:58:16,108
I will show you.

1121
01:58:19,978 --> 01:58:21,859
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1122
01:58:21,942 --> 01:58:23,775
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1123
01:58:23,855 --> 01:58:25,445
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1124
01:58:25,525 --> 01:58:27,445
"And so say all of us."

1125
01:58:27,525 --> 01:58:29,107
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

1126
01:58:29,188 --> 01:58:30,859
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

1127
01:58:30,942 --> 01:58:32,900
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1128
01:58:32,984 --> 01:58:34,650
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1129
01:58:34,730 --> 01:58:36,567
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1130
01:58:36,650 --> 01:58:38,441
"And so say all of us."

1131
01:58:38,521 --> 01:58:41,971
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

1132
01:58:42,51 --> 01:58:43,817
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1133
01:58:43,897 --> 01:58:45,692
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1134
01:58:45,772 --> 01:58:47,445
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1135
01:58:47,525 --> 01:58:49,192
"And so say all of us."

1136
01:58:49,273 --> 01:58:51,226
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

1137
01:58:51,306 --> 01:58:52,995
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

1138
01:58:53,75 --> 01:58:54,779
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1139
01:58:54,859 --> 01:58:56,592
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1140
01:58:56,672 --> 01:58:58,400
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1141
01:58:58,480 --> 01:58:59,989
"And so say all of us."

1142
01:59:00,313 --> 01:59:01,987
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

1143
01:59:02,67 --> 01:59:03,734
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

1144
01:59:04,6 --> 01:59:05,734
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1145
01:59:05,814 --> 01:59:07,581
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1146
01:59:07,661 --> 01:59:09,437
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1147
01:59:09,517 --> 01:59:11,195
"And so say all of us."

1148
01:59:11,275 --> 01:59:13,67
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

1149
01:59:13,147 --> 01:59:14,900
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

1150
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:15,942
"He is a jolly good fellow."

1151
01:59:16,25 --> 01:59:18,108
Tell me something.
- What?

1152
01:59:19,966 --> 01:59:21,423
Who are you looking for?

1153
01:59:25,389 --> 01:59:26,680
Want me to tell you?

1154
01:59:28,441 --> 01:59:29,483
Look, over there.

1155
01:59:37,109 --> 01:59:38,234
Raj!

1156
01:59:42,151 --> 01:59:43,345
Raj!

1157
01:59:46,567 --> 01:59:47,692
Raj!

1158
01:59:52,151 --> 01:59:53,608
So you came.

1159
01:59:55,734 --> 01:59:57,401
Happy twenty-first.

1160
02:00:03,154 --> 02:00:08,67
Your gift.
- Why did you have to do this?

1161
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:11,942
Why did you have to buy
such an expensive necklace?

1162
02:00:13,484 --> 02:00:19,433
For you, nothing is too expensive.
Besides, I stole it.

1163
02:00:20,233 --> 02:00:24,386
You stole it?
- I stole it from the stars.

1164
02:00:25,612 --> 02:00:28,398
You're such a...
- A savage?

1165
02:00:28,856 --> 02:00:31,117
What else? You are a savage.

1166
02:00:32,317 --> 02:00:34,557
You buy this expensive gift...

1167
02:00:35,665 --> 02:00:39,246
but you won't spend
for a velvet case.

1168
02:00:40,161 --> 02:00:41,821
Case?

1169
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:46,179
Rita, the Judge is calling you.
Hurry up.

1170
02:00:46,373 --> 02:00:47,331
Coming.

1171
02:00:53,146 --> 02:00:54,306
What's on your mind?

1172
02:00:59,233 --> 02:01:01,150
Let me introduce you to the Judge.

1173
02:01:03,525 --> 02:01:04,670
Come on.

1174
02:01:31,566 --> 02:01:34,220
Rita, I've been waiting for you.

1175
02:01:34,853 --> 02:01:40,274
First, my present.
- See if you like it.

1176
02:01:45,691 --> 02:01:48,233
Why, don't you like it?

1177
02:01:49,358 --> 02:01:53,13
Today's a strange day. Someone
gives me a necklace sans a case.

1178
02:01:53,358 --> 02:01:55,195
And someone give me a case
sans the necklace.

1179
02:02:15,905 --> 02:02:22,152
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

1180
02:02:22,233 --> 02:02:27,639
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

1181
02:02:27,719 --> 02:02:33,955
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

1182
02:02:34,35 --> 02:02:39,260
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

1183
02:02:50,978 --> 02:02:56,704
"A man with an innocent face,
turned out to be a thief."

1184
02:02:56,784 --> 02:03:02,353
"He hides the darkness inside,
but his face is bright."

1185
02:03:02,684 --> 02:03:08,248
"A man with an innocent face,
turned out to be a thief."

1186
02:03:08,532 --> 02:03:13,517
"He hides the darkness inside,
but his face is bright."

1187
02:03:13,597 --> 02:03:19,691
"I gave my heart,
I made myself fervent."

1188
02:03:19,771 --> 02:03:25,175
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

1189
02:03:25,255 --> 02:03:31,499
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

1190
02:03:31,579 --> 02:03:36,938
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

1191
02:03:44,14 --> 02:03:49,301
"I was betrayed,
by his cobalt blue eyes."

1192
02:03:49,381 --> 02:03:52,412
"The cobalt blue eyes."

1193
02:03:56,4 --> 02:04:01,393
"I was betrayed,
by his cobalt blue eyes."

1194
02:04:01,473 --> 02:04:04,570
"The cobalt blue eyes."

1195
02:04:04,952 --> 02:04:09,681
"The heart is lonely,
the eyes are wet."

1196
02:04:10,77 --> 02:04:13,85
"The eyes are wet."

1197
02:04:13,165 --> 02:04:19,191
"I trusted him.
I proposed my love to him."

1198
02:04:19,271 --> 02:04:24,610
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

1199
02:04:24,690 --> 02:04:30,925
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

1200
02:04:31,6 --> 02:04:36,981
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

1201
02:04:46,153 --> 02:04:49,284
Rita, what have you done?

1202
02:04:50,867 --> 02:04:52,945
Fallen in love with a thief?

1203
02:04:54,703 --> 02:04:58,128
And Raju, you?

1204
02:04:59,389 --> 02:05:01,972
Is it some gift you don't like?

1205
02:05:03,956 --> 02:05:09,389
I'm going to return his gift.

1206
02:05:13,422 --> 02:05:15,5
Rita.

1207
02:05:17,36 --> 02:05:22,597
Bring him over.
I'd like to meet him.

1208
02:05:36,566 --> 02:05:39,955
Raj isn't a bad boy.
He has just gone astray.

1209
02:05:40,729 --> 02:05:45,733
All he needs is someone to love him,
to support him, to bring him around.

1210
02:05:47,301 --> 02:05:52,438
He respects you. If you want it,
Raj can be saved.

1211
02:05:53,566 --> 02:05:57,818
Is Raj not at home?
- No. He went out early in the morning.

1212
02:05:57,899 --> 02:05:59,406
He isn't back yet.

1213
02:06:02,150 --> 02:06:03,566
Okay, mother.

1214
02:06:20,601 --> 02:06:26,160
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

1215
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:31,746
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

1216
02:06:31,826 --> 02:06:37,333
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

1217
02:06:37,413 --> 02:06:42,732
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

1218
02:06:42,816 --> 02:06:48,443
"I happily endure the
perils of love."

1219
02:06:48,524 --> 02:06:53,986
"I happily endure the
perils of love."

1220
02:06:54,66 --> 02:06:59,528
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

1221
02:06:59,608 --> 02:07:05,649
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

1222
02:07:13,524 --> 02:07:21,691
"What do you know the
love of the heart!"

1223
02:07:21,774 --> 02:07:27,899
"A pain aroused, and my
eyes brimmed with tears."

1224
02:07:30,65 --> 02:07:38,335
"What do you know the
love of the heart!"

1225
02:07:38,415 --> 02:07:43,885
"A pain aroused, and my
eyes brimmed with tears."

1226
02:07:43,966 --> 02:07:46,649
"My eyes brimmed with tears."

1227
02:07:49,401 --> 02:07:54,733
"But I remained silent."

1228
02:07:54,816 --> 02:08:00,358
"But I remained silent,
I swear on this sadness."

1229
02:08:00,441 --> 02:08:05,816
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

1230
02:08:05,899 --> 02:08:12,24
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

1231
02:08:19,737 --> 02:08:26,662
"When the heart burned,
there was a fire."

1232
02:08:28,60 --> 02:08:33,816
"When my tears flowed, it rained."

1233
02:08:36,228 --> 02:08:44,556
"When the heart burned,
there was a fire."

1234
02:08:44,636 --> 02:08:50,66
"When my tears flowed, it rained."

1235
02:08:50,146 --> 02:08:52,733
"It rained."

1236
02:08:55,633 --> 02:08:58,791
"Like a cloud."

1237
02:09:01,167 --> 02:09:06,611
"Like a cloud, I was a vagabond."

1238
02:09:06,691 --> 02:09:12,191
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

1239
02:09:12,271 --> 02:09:17,654
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

1240
02:09:17,734 --> 02:09:23,196
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

1241
02:09:23,276 --> 02:09:28,739
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

1242
02:09:28,819 --> 02:09:34,290
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

1243
02:09:34,370 --> 02:09:40,721
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

1244
02:09:43,121 --> 02:09:44,454
Raj!

1245
02:09:47,204 --> 02:09:51,7
There you are. Haven't you
brought the police along?

1246
02:09:52,89 --> 02:09:53,996
That bitterness is of no use.

1247
02:09:56,515 --> 02:09:58,163
Your mother has told me everything.

1248
02:10:01,337 --> 02:10:05,674
So you know I'm vagabond,
I've been to jail...

1249
02:10:07,179 --> 02:10:11,329
...and my name is on the police rolls.
Is that what you've come to tell me?

1250
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:17,623
Try to understand me, Raj.
I still consider you my friend.

1251
02:10:19,299 --> 02:10:20,496
Friend?

1252
02:10:22,646 --> 02:10:29,411
A lawyer's daughter, a judge's ward
takes a tramp for a friend?

1253
02:10:29,933 --> 02:10:33,916
What's your society going to say?
What will your people say?

1254
02:10:34,233 --> 02:10:37,358
If you recant, society
will forgive your past.

1255
02:10:37,708 --> 02:10:41,879
Raj, you can make a new life
for yourself... you can!

1256
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:46,648
A new life? On what
will I build a new life?

1257
02:10:48,162 --> 02:10:53,41
Can you give me back my childhood,
the education I never had?

1258
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:59,124
Everyone says that I have no father
to name... I have no honour!

1259
02:10:59,554 --> 02:11:02,926
Can you bring my father back?
Can you give me my name?

1260
02:11:03,354 --> 02:11:08,27
Can you give me my honour?
Tell me... tell me Rita!

1261
02:11:09,589 --> 02:11:10,988
Why are you quiet?

1262
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:17,738
Rita, I've kept you in the dark.
I've kept myself in the dark.

1263
02:11:19,726 --> 02:11:23,530
Forget me Rita.
Leave me to myself.

1264
02:11:25,25 --> 02:11:26,607
I am not worthy of you.

1265
02:11:27,410 --> 02:11:29,400
You realise fully well,
yet you want to live in this hell.

1266
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:31,858
I never imagined you'd be so weak.

1267
02:11:32,815 --> 02:11:35,650
Rita, don't you think I never tried
to get out of this hell.

1268
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:38,775
But tell me, what do I do?

1269
02:11:39,588 --> 02:11:42,483
For twelve years, the world
has chased me towards crime.

1270
02:11:43,416 --> 02:11:45,608
Alone, I cannot face it.

1271
02:11:46,652 --> 02:11:48,733
Alone, I cannot.

1272
02:11:50,137 --> 02:11:53,567
You aren't alone, Raj.
Your mother is with you.

1273
02:11:55,289 --> 02:12:01,317
I'm with you.
- You? With me? With a criminal?

1274
02:12:01,623 --> 02:12:05,383
Yes Raj. With you, forever.

1275
02:12:07,317 --> 02:12:13,000
Good or not, guilty or not,
whatever you are, you're mine.

1276
02:12:16,88 --> 02:12:20,603
This is a matter of the heart. And
the scales of justice cannot judge it.

1277
02:12:23,74 --> 02:12:28,492
But this guilt I carry
with me forever?

1278
02:12:29,859 --> 02:12:32,815
For me, as your wife, it will
be the bride's vermillion.

1279
02:12:38,229 --> 02:12:39,527
Really?

1280
02:12:41,345 --> 02:12:43,583
Come with me.
- Where?

1281
02:12:44,437 --> 02:12:46,396
The Judge wants to meet you.

1282
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:50,104
The Judge?
- Yes.

1283
02:13:07,817 --> 02:13:08,946
Sit.

1284
02:13:18,604 --> 02:13:19,923
Name?

1285
02:13:20,794 --> 02:13:21,951
Raj.

1286
02:13:22,553 --> 02:13:25,201
Only Raj?
- Yes.

1287
02:13:29,63 --> 02:13:30,284
Your father's name?

1288
02:13:31,783 --> 02:13:33,111
I don't know.

1289
02:13:41,387 --> 02:13:43,719
I see.
What do you do?

1290
02:13:44,643 --> 02:13:48,728
As of now, unemployed.
Like millions of others.

1291
02:13:49,3 --> 02:13:52,40
Any other source of income?
Property?

1292
02:13:55,313 --> 02:13:56,482
Nothing.

1293
02:13:56,781 --> 02:14:01,506
Do you remember polishing boots
when you were a boy?

1294
02:14:02,130 --> 02:14:04,541
I still do.

1295
02:14:04,621 --> 02:14:10,000
And you want to marry Rita?
- Yes. If you allow me.

1296
02:14:10,80 --> 02:14:13,416
And you've been to jail too?
- Rita must've told you that...

1297
02:14:13,496 --> 02:14:17,455
You've recanted? Have you found
another source of making money?

1298
02:14:18,416 --> 02:14:22,621
No.
- But there's still hope, isn't it?

1299
02:14:23,82 --> 02:14:27,580
If some silly rich girl marries you...
- Did you call me here to insult me?

1300
02:14:29,612 --> 02:14:30,913
Judge sir..

1301
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:34,913
We are in love.

1302
02:14:36,182 --> 02:14:38,742
We want to marry.
- All that I've heard.

1303
02:14:39,972 --> 02:14:41,241
Love!

1304
02:14:43,981 --> 02:14:45,284
Sit.

1305
02:14:46,827 --> 02:14:48,881
And let's talk it over
with a cool head.

1306
02:14:49,414 --> 02:14:52,384
What do you mean?
- I mean that though I don't know...

1307
02:14:52,464 --> 02:14:54,381
..how you managed to seduce
a naive girl..

1308
02:14:55,748 --> 02:14:58,298
..it's clear why you played this trick.

1309
02:14:59,745 --> 02:15:02,214
I want to know what price
you'll take to let her go.

1310
02:15:06,803 --> 02:15:07,970
Judge Raghunath.

1311
02:15:09,470 --> 02:15:14,928
Till today, I thought
I was the worst scoundrel on earth.

1312
02:15:16,405 --> 02:15:19,244
But you turn out to be
one up on me!

1313
02:15:19,324 --> 02:15:22,879
You scum! How dare you use
your filthy colloquy?

1314
02:15:23,282 --> 02:15:26,554
You think I'm going to let
Rita marry a tramp like you?

1315
02:15:27,303 --> 02:15:31,762
She'd rather stay a spinster for life.
Better by far that she dies!

1316
02:15:33,19 --> 02:15:39,811
Why not say that you'd rather
she married some rich big-shot?

1317
02:15:40,644 --> 02:15:44,381
Or maybe, some judge?
- Out of here. Get out.

1318
02:15:59,371 --> 02:16:01,329
Before I leave, I'd like
to ask you a question.

1319
02:16:03,954 --> 02:16:08,701
What if it was your son in my place?
And because he's poor...

1320
02:16:08,781 --> 02:16:15,260
..because he was brought up in the slums
and was forced into crime...

1321
02:16:15,893 --> 02:16:18,357
...what if it was he who was being
denied his love, his life?

1322
02:16:19,310 --> 02:16:21,288
How would you have felt?

1323
02:16:33,655 --> 02:16:34,746
Raj!

1324
02:16:38,538 --> 02:16:40,262
Raj! Raj!

1325
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:43,290
Jagga has called you.

1326
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:46,322
There's a big heist.
A bank is to be looted.

1327
02:17:21,977 --> 02:17:23,77
Open the door!

1328
02:17:25,664 --> 02:17:28,250
Open up.
- Who is it?

1329
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:29,798
Open up!

1330
02:17:31,144 --> 02:17:33,9
Open the door!

1331
02:17:36,563 --> 02:17:37,874
Who is there?
- Open the door!

1332
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:47,294
Who are you?

1333
02:17:48,948 --> 02:17:50,900
Don't you know me?

1334
02:17:52,755 --> 02:17:54,358
I'm Jagga.

1335
02:17:56,441 --> 02:17:57,691
Jagga!

1336
02:17:58,775 --> 02:18:02,521
The bandit?
- You could say so.

1337
02:18:03,316 --> 02:18:06,629
What do you want here?
- Silence!

1338
02:18:08,775 --> 02:18:11,525
The police are after me.
Where's Raj?

1339
02:18:14,188 --> 02:18:17,355
Get out of my house! I will do nothing
to help someone like you!

1340
02:18:23,150 --> 02:18:29,66
I had you once, and I let you go
Remember the day?

1341
02:18:30,31 --> 02:18:35,650
For twelve years, I cared for your son.
I made his life! For this day?

1342
02:18:35,975 --> 02:18:39,767
Made my son's life?
You forced him into crime.

1343
02:18:40,787 --> 02:18:44,714
Get out of my house. I don't want
your cursed shadow upon my son!

1344
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:47,529
Get out! Get out of my house!

1345
02:18:47,609 --> 02:18:49,235
Police! Police!

1346
02:18:53,984 --> 02:18:56,862
Go on! Call the police!
- Police!

1347
02:18:56,941 --> 02:19:00,786
Let me see who saves you!
Scream!

1348
02:19:01,236 --> 02:19:02,317
Jagga!

1349
02:19:07,947 --> 02:19:13,67
Will you challenge your boss?
- You're no boss. You're Satan!

1350
02:19:16,584 --> 02:19:18,25
Satan!

1351
02:19:28,281 --> 02:19:30,829
Let's hear what you have to say now.

1352
02:19:55,518 --> 02:19:56,573
Raj!

1353
02:19:59,679 --> 02:20:03,171
Raj! No! No! Mercy!

1354
02:20:06,769 --> 02:20:08,890
No! Enough!

1355
02:20:09,893 --> 02:20:10,942
Jagga!

1356
02:20:44,856 --> 02:20:49,317
What have you done Raj?
- For my sins, this is atonement!

1357
02:21:05,849 --> 02:21:06,884
Police!

1358
02:21:23,885 --> 02:21:25,384
The accused may be presented.

1359
02:21:33,324 --> 02:21:36,887
What's the name of the accused?
- Sir, his name is Raj.

1360
02:21:43,522 --> 02:21:47,349
Father's name?
- Not known, sir. Maybe he has none.

1361
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:51,629
Order!

1362
02:21:53,315 --> 02:21:58,712
Raj, you have been accused
of killing Jagga.

1363
02:21:59,667 --> 02:22:01,503
Do you have anything to say
in your defence?

1364
02:22:05,102 --> 02:22:08,45
Have you not appointed a lawyer
to defend yourself?

1365
02:22:13,856 --> 02:22:19,425
The case is adjourned. The government
will appoint a counsel for the defence.

1366
02:22:19,505 --> 02:22:24,668
I know the law. Raj killed
in self-defence. That's no crime.

1367
02:22:25,487 --> 02:22:28,961
Please save my Raj, somehow.

1368
02:22:29,49 --> 02:22:32,550
Your deposition is very important.
The whole case hinges on it.

1369
02:22:33,132 --> 02:22:35,981
Come to the court tomorrow.
- All right. Okay, dear.

1370
02:22:55,912 --> 02:22:57,245
Husband!

1371
02:23:02,787 --> 02:23:04,55
She is unconscious.

1372
02:23:04,135 --> 02:23:07,830
Move back! Move! Move!

1373
02:23:08,305 --> 02:23:11,995
Is she dead?
- She has been hurt on the head.

1374
02:23:13,707 --> 02:23:20,662
And Raj killed Jagga
to save my life.

1375
02:23:22,662 --> 02:23:26,495
Please sign here. This deposition
will surely save Raj.

1376
02:23:28,813 --> 02:23:34,162
If Raj is saved, I will be able
to die in peace.

1377
02:23:34,870 --> 02:23:36,449
I should be leaving now.

1378
02:23:49,829 --> 02:23:51,537
Mother!

1379
02:23:51,617 --> 02:23:53,457
My son!
- What happened to you, Ma?

1380
02:23:53,537 --> 02:23:54,665
My son!

1381
02:23:54,745 --> 02:23:59,165
That heartless judge has killed you!
What is his enmity with us?

1382
02:23:59,245 --> 02:24:01,162
You mustn't blame him, son.
- Why not?

1383
02:24:01,656 --> 02:24:03,379
He has always been tying
to make us miserable.

1384
02:24:03,459 --> 02:24:06,287
No son! He is your father.

1385
02:24:08,887 --> 02:24:10,92
My father?

1386
02:24:11,103 --> 02:24:15,79
What are you saying, Ma?
What has come over you?

1387
02:24:16,135 --> 02:24:20,111
I'm not out of my mind, son.
What I'm saying is the truth.

1388
02:24:21,9 --> 02:24:23,120
I could not bring myself
to tell you this until now.

1389
02:24:24,746 --> 02:24:29,762
But if not today, once I'm gone
who else could tell you?

1390
02:24:31,106 --> 02:24:35,438
This can't be, Ma!
This can never be!

1391
02:24:35,518 --> 02:24:40,215
This is a long story.
But I don't have the time.

1392
02:24:41,597 --> 02:24:45,598
Keep this. I'm leaving.

1393
02:24:47,85 --> 02:24:50,579
He will surely recognise you
when you show him this.

1394
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:55,637
He has never forgiven me.

1395
02:24:56,684 --> 02:25:00,579
But he will surely forgive his son.

1396
02:25:03,536 --> 02:25:06,495
I won't seek mercy from the one
who tortured my mother all her life...

1397
02:25:07,510 --> 02:25:13,120
..the one who made her beg from door
to door. I won't have his mercy!

1398
02:25:14,198 --> 02:25:16,354
Ma, I won't have his mercy!

1399
02:25:16,943 --> 02:25:21,833
If I could see him for
once before I died...

1400
02:25:23,118 --> 02:25:25,133
But why would he come here.

1401
02:25:25,414 --> 02:25:28,274
Come.
- I'm leaving Ma.

1402
02:25:29,177 --> 02:25:30,260
Son!

1403
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:32,847
I'll avenge you, I will.
- No!

1404
02:25:32,927 --> 02:25:35,94
I'll surely avenge you, I will.
- No, son!.

1405
02:25:35,751 --> 02:25:36,927
Son!

1406
02:25:45,52 --> 02:25:47,385
The Judge is here to see you.

1407
02:25:48,552 --> 02:25:53,688
Which Judge?
- The one whose car ran you over.

1408
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:04,636
So he has come... before I'm dead.

1409
02:26:05,639 --> 02:26:07,597
Alas, I cannot see.

1410
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:14,374
Nurse, give him my greetings.

1411
02:26:15,316 --> 02:26:21,139
I am ashamed about the accident.
Please forgive me.

1412
02:26:21,219 --> 02:26:24,597
Forgive you?

1413
02:26:32,30 --> 02:26:33,192
Doctor!

1414
02:27:12,934 --> 02:27:14,59
Mother!

1415
02:27:15,458 --> 02:27:19,329
You didn't die! You were killed!

1416
02:27:20,250 --> 02:27:25,208
That heartless judge has killed you!
To make sure that he isn't exposed!

1417
02:27:49,831 --> 02:27:50,888
Judge sir!

1418
02:28:03,179 --> 02:28:04,287
Judge sir!

1419
02:28:05,323 --> 02:28:07,543
Have you decided the verdict
about the case?

1420
02:28:11,837 --> 02:28:15,975
Case?
- Raj's case.

1421
02:28:17,627 --> 02:28:22,219
You are going mad!
What are you doing to yourself?

1422
02:28:22,994 --> 02:28:25,60
You are a mature, educated woman.

1423
02:28:26,680 --> 02:28:29,125
In a few days, you'll start
going to court as a lawyer.

1424
02:28:29,846 --> 02:28:36,778
You might even make a judge.
If you get emotional over every case...

1425
02:28:37,174 --> 02:28:38,740
..you will never be able to
dispense justice.

1426
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:42,101
This is not a lawsuit.
It's my life!

1427
02:28:46,253 --> 02:28:50,326
Do you not understand as much?
- Irrespective, it won't alter the law.

1428
02:28:51,426 --> 02:28:53,395
Nor should you let your emotions
come in the way of justice.

1429
02:28:53,476 --> 02:28:57,415
Justice is all I seek.
Raj is completely innocent.

1430
02:28:57,716 --> 02:29:00,305
He killed Jagga tying to save
his mother.

1431
02:29:00,491 --> 02:29:02,972
You can read his mother's
dying declaration.

1432
02:29:04,244 --> 02:29:06,639
In this particular case,
Raj might merit pardon.

1433
02:29:07,491 --> 02:29:10,472
But his whole life is a long story
of involvement with crime and sin.

1434
02:29:11,372 --> 02:29:15,764
I cannot comprehend how you can
sympathise with such a person.

1435
02:29:16,959 --> 02:29:20,97
How can you love him?

1436
02:29:21,234 --> 02:29:22,847
You have studied the law.

1437
02:29:31,519 --> 02:29:35,764
But my heart has not read the laws.

1438
02:29:37,403 --> 02:29:40,472
Heart... and the laws.

1439
02:29:43,396 --> 02:29:47,55
The laws... and the heart.

1440
02:29:49,880 --> 02:29:51,847
What a strange concoction.

1441
02:29:53,645 --> 02:29:55,414
But you are right.

1442
02:29:57,754 --> 02:29:59,680
The heart heeds no laws.

1443
02:30:01,756 --> 02:30:03,847
No laws at all.

1444
02:30:05,821 --> 02:30:06,972
Not even mine.

1445
02:30:26,735 --> 02:30:28,800
No!
- Get out, Rita.

1446
02:30:31,307 --> 02:30:34,139
I'm in a murderous rage!
- Have you gone mad?

1447
02:30:34,936 --> 02:30:37,555
So you have escaped?
- Yes.

1448
02:30:38,917 --> 02:30:40,241
To settle the score with you.

1449
02:30:40,321 --> 02:30:41,76
Raj..

1450
02:30:41,156 --> 02:30:46,680
Then you will be happy to know
that your lawyer...

1451
02:30:48,26 --> 02:30:50,597
...had just convinced me
about your innocence.

1452
02:30:51,687 --> 02:30:54,441
I was inclined to let you off
tomorrow.

1453
02:30:55,268 --> 02:30:57,212
I want no mercy from you.

1454
02:30:57,978 --> 02:31:00,639
I don't want your justice,
your law, nothing!

1455
02:31:01,691 --> 02:31:02,889
All I want...

1456
02:31:06,908 --> 02:31:11,805
Lost your nerve?
You need guts to kill someone.

1457
02:31:12,890 --> 02:31:16,722
You should be thanking the one
who has just saved your life.

1458
02:31:19,733 --> 02:31:22,14
What if I were to use this very knife
to rip your heart out?

1459
02:31:22,513 --> 02:31:24,597
What else can the verdict
of the courts be?

1460
02:31:25,90 --> 02:31:29,550
Judge Raghunath was compelled to kill
a criminal to save his own life.

1461
02:31:29,630 --> 02:31:37,97
Have you gone out of your mind too?
- I was. For a second.

1462
02:31:40,64 --> 02:31:44,347
For the scum that he is,
the hangman's noose will be better.

1463
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:50,350
Raj. Raj.

1464
02:31:51,907 --> 02:31:54,493
This is the story of
Raj's life and crimes.

1465
02:31:55,197 --> 02:31:59,438
Now you know why and how
he took to crime.

1466
02:32:00,502 --> 02:32:04,673
My Lord, the one who is guilty
is his father...

1467
02:32:04,892 --> 02:32:08,789
..who drove an innocent woman from
his house, and denied his own son.

1468
02:32:09,144 --> 02:32:10,981
He is the one who forced them
to go begging from door to door.

1469
02:32:11,61 --> 02:32:15,554
And in the company of criminals,
he went astray.

1470
02:32:16,228 --> 02:32:18,704
My Lord and members of the Jury...

1471
02:32:18,933 --> 02:32:21,269
..if Raj is to be punished
for his crime..

1472
02:32:21,353 --> 02:32:23,515
..then his father should be
punished too.

1473
02:32:23,595 --> 02:32:26,345
My Lord, I would like to say something.

1474
02:32:27,993 --> 02:32:32,321
Emotion has got the better
of the counsel for defence.

1475
02:32:33,95 --> 02:32:35,672
In her anxiety to save the accused,
the counsel has presented...

1476
02:32:36,803 --> 02:32:40,345
..an interesting story,
however incongruous it might be...

1477
02:32:42,659 --> 02:32:46,398
..to try and prove that
some criminal happens to be my son!

1478
02:32:47,928 --> 02:32:52,931
But I ask, what evidence
does the counsel have?

1479
02:32:53,11 --> 02:32:56,223
No evidence on earth will convince you
that Raj is your son...

1480
02:32:56,303 --> 02:32:58,767
..not unless you are willing
to accept him as your son.

1481
02:32:59,553 --> 02:33:04,362
If there be proof, it lies deep
in your heart and in Raj's eyes.

1482
02:33:04,898 --> 02:33:09,314
Look at him. The same eyes,
the same high brow.

1483
02:33:09,552 --> 02:33:12,789
He even speaks like you speak.
He's just as adamant as you are.

1484
02:33:13,654 --> 02:33:15,970
Are you still not willing
to accept him as your son?

1485
02:33:16,223 --> 02:33:18,648
Ms Rita, the law heeds no emotion.

1486
02:33:19,739 --> 02:33:22,678
Nor my Lord, does the heart
heed any law.

1487
02:33:24,781 --> 02:33:26,223
I have no more to say.

1488
02:33:29,786 --> 02:33:34,77
If the accused has anything to say
in his defence, he may proceed.

1489
02:33:42,435 --> 02:33:48,545
Yes. At last,
after being branded a murderer...

1490
02:33:49,601 --> 02:33:51,897
..I hold your attention.

1491
02:33:53,278 --> 02:33:58,407
Had I been heard earlier, perhaps
I would never have had to stand here.

1492
02:34:00,286 --> 02:34:03,244
Ms Rita has tried her best
to save me from being hanged.

1493
02:34:03,436 --> 02:34:06,502
And not only in this particular case;
in my personal life too.

1494
02:34:06,582 --> 02:34:11,24
In my defence, I wish to say nothing.
I am evil.

1495
02:34:11,967 --> 02:34:13,558
I've been a vagabond ever since
I was a child.

1496
02:34:14,174 --> 02:34:16,175
I'm a murderer, a criminal.

1497
02:34:17,550 --> 02:34:22,300
You may punish me as you please.
But sin, crime, hatred and violence...

1498
02:34:22,383 --> 02:34:25,428
..this vicious circle that holds
your society in a vice-grip...

1499
02:34:25,508 --> 02:34:27,985
..do you think it can be broken
by hanging me?

1500
02:34:28,557 --> 02:34:30,915
I don't want to tell you
the story of my life.

1501
02:34:31,467 --> 02:34:37,337
But all I want to say is, I did not
inherit crime from my parents.

1502
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:41,303
From that gutter full of filth
that flows beside my shanty...

1503
02:34:41,383 --> 02:34:46,408
...I picked up crime. That gutter
is still flowing over.

1504
02:34:47,633 --> 02:34:50,34
And the virus still breeds.

1505
02:34:52,592 --> 02:34:55,592
And countless children who live
in those slums...

1506
02:34:56,467 --> 02:34:58,481
..are falling prey to the virus
every day.

1507
02:34:59,202 --> 02:35:04,133
Do not think of me. Those children
are the ones you must care for.

1508
02:35:06,336 --> 02:35:08,184
You must care for your children.

1509
02:35:09,688 --> 02:35:12,883
Lest come the day when...
yours...

1510
02:35:13,911 --> 02:35:15,467
..and yours...

1511
02:35:15,794 --> 02:35:17,383
..and yours...

1512
02:35:19,41 --> 02:35:21,425
..and your son too stands
in these docks to reiterate...

1513
02:35:21,505 --> 02:35:24,550
..that it's an honest father's blood
that flows in my veins.

1514
02:35:26,229 --> 02:35:29,758
Time was when I was an innocent boy,
just like your sons.

1515
02:35:31,313 --> 02:35:34,550
Like all mothers, my mother too
wove a golden dream for me.

1516
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:40,592
She would say, "My son will grow up
to become a lawyer".

1517
02:35:41,923 --> 02:35:48,925
Then he will become a magistrate.
And then, a judge... like his father.

1518
02:35:50,236 --> 02:35:52,383
I know the verdict that this court
is about to give.

1519
02:35:53,650 --> 02:35:58,927
And I'm willing to suffer any sentence.
For my sins, this is atonement.

1520
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:03,342
But I await the decision
from yet another quarter.

1521
02:36:05,270 --> 02:36:10,217
I want to know Judge Raghunath,
what says your heart?

1522
02:36:11,957 --> 02:36:13,842
What says your heart?

1523
02:36:38,631 --> 02:36:39,608
Raj!

1524
02:37:25,548 --> 02:37:27,936
Has the Judge come to see his convict?

1525
02:37:30,954 --> 02:37:32,297
A father...

1526
02:37:34,590 --> 02:37:35,757
..who is guilty.

1527
02:37:37,623 --> 02:37:39,162
Guilty? You?

1528
02:37:39,242 --> 02:37:40,473
Yes.

1529
02:37:41,789 --> 02:37:44,498
Tomorrow, the law might
pronounce you guilty.

1530
02:37:46,706 --> 02:37:51,301
But in the eyes of God,
I am the one who is guilty.

1531
02:37:54,110 --> 02:37:55,226
Are you weeping?

1532
02:37:56,203 --> 02:38:00,987
Yes, for the father who found his son,
and yet he has lost him.

1533
02:38:01,938 --> 02:38:04,445
For the husband who forced his wife
to become a widow.

1534
02:38:04,525 --> 02:38:07,595
For society, where poverty
breeds crime.

1535
02:38:07,684 --> 02:38:09,600
For the son who is orphaned
though his father is alive.

1536
02:38:09,681 --> 02:38:11,448
For the child who goes through life
looking for someone...

1537
02:38:11,528 --> 02:38:12,944
..who will call him "Son".

1538
02:38:13,314 --> 02:38:14,475
Son.

1539
02:38:17,43 --> 02:38:18,258
Son!

1540
02:38:22,770 --> 02:38:23,839
Son!

1541
02:38:55,964 --> 02:39:01,39
Raj, son of Judge Raghunath,
you have been proved guilty...

1542
02:39:01,119 --> 02:39:03,986
..of tying to assassinate
your father, Judge Raghunath.

1543
02:39:04,453 --> 02:39:08,544
But in the light of the strange and
unfortunate circumstances your life...

1544
02:39:08,913 --> 02:39:12,202
..which your counsel Ms Rita
has presented...

1545
02:39:12,282 --> 02:39:15,688
..you are sentenced to only three years
of rigorous imprisonment.

1546
02:39:53,385 --> 02:39:54,591
Crying?

1547
02:39:55,778 --> 02:39:56,852
You silly girl.

1548
02:39:57,784 --> 02:39:59,252
Silly, lawyers never cry.

1549
02:40:00,195 --> 02:40:01,987
At this rate, how are you
going to practice?

1550
02:40:02,808 --> 02:40:08,529
What use is the practice, Raj?
I wasn't able to save you.

1551
02:40:09,985 --> 02:40:14,309
No Rita, this penance
is very important for me.

1552
02:40:16,178 --> 02:40:18,601
Only after I've been through this,
will I be worthy of you.

1553
02:40:21,61 --> 02:40:23,268
With you beside me,
I can go through anything.

1554
02:40:26,666 --> 02:40:28,161
I will become an honest man.

1555
02:40:29,788 --> 02:40:31,459
Everyone will say I'm a good man.

1556
02:40:33,219 --> 02:40:35,600
I will read, I will write.

1557
02:40:37,661 --> 02:40:41,18
And just like Ma used to say,
first I'll become a lawyer...

1558
02:40:41,936 --> 02:40:43,434
..then a magistrate.

1559
02:40:46,93 --> 02:40:47,134
And then, a judge.

1560
02:40:50,634 --> 02:40:55,767
Last night I saw a judge.
And I liked him.

1561
02:40:58,68 --> 02:41:00,51
I'll become a judge.

1562
02:41:01,878 --> 02:41:04,37
You won't call me a savage anymore,
will you?

1563
02:41:04,341 --> 02:41:06,668
I will. You savage!

1564
02:41:12,21 --> 02:41:13,426
Time up.

1565
02:41:14,792 --> 02:41:16,108
Come on.

1566
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:32,163
Keep this.

1567
02:41:33,333 --> 02:41:34,801
It's your gift.

1568
02:41:37,71 --> 02:41:39,968
Don't worry. I didn't steal it.

1569
02:41:40,556 --> 02:41:42,429
I just smuggled it in.

1570
02:41:42,773 --> 02:41:43,951
Raj.

1571
02:41:56,505 --> 02:42:02,641
Not your fault, Rita.
It's just the way I look.

1572
02:42:04,644 --> 02:42:05,747
Raj.

1573
02:42:06,315 --> 02:42:07,404
Raj.

1574
02:42:09,218 --> 02:42:15,530
Three years isn't too long, Raj.
I'll wait for you.

1575
02:42:15,757 --> 02:42:16,726
Rita.

1576
02:42:17,508 --> 02:42:20,106
I'll wait for you!
- Don't cry.

1577
02:42:25,659 --> 02:42:30,196
Number 308... move it.

1578
02:42:33,945 --> 02:42:35,168
I should be.

1579
02:42:52,261 --> 02:42:55,26
"I'm not flourishing,
I am not ruined."

1580
02:42:55,106 --> 02:42:57,867
"Still I sing happy songs."

1581
02:42:57,947 --> 02:43:02,2
"Still I sing happy songs."

1582
02:43:02,82 --> 02:43:04,809
"My heart is filled with wounds."

1583
02:43:04,889 --> 02:43:08,318
"But still these lively eyes smile."

1584
02:43:10,782 --> 02:43:13,465
"World.."

1585
02:43:16,447 --> 02:43:22,609
"World, I am troubled by your
sorrows or misfortunes."

1586
02:43:27,757 --> 02:43:33,364
"I am a vagabond."
