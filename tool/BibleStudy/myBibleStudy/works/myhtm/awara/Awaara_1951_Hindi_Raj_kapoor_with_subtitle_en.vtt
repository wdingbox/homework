00:03:58.877 --> 00:04:01.877 align:middle line:84%
Spice for the front page, isn't it?

00:04:01.877 --> 00:04:04.955 align:middle line:90%
All you can think of are
headlines for the front page.

00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:06.355 align:middle line:84%
Oh, drop it!

00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:21.815 align:middle line:84%
Here comes Judge Raghunath.

00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:26.698 align:middle line:90%
Such a gentleman! Why on earth
did that goon want to kill him?

00:04:26.698 --> 00:05:00.554 align:middle line:84%
Here comes your friend.

00:05:00.554 --> 00:05:03.895 align:middle line:90%
Is the jury in place?
- Yes, my Lord. Present.

00:05:03.895 --> 00:05:06.324 align:middle line:90%
Is the accused present?
- Present, my Lord.

00:05:06.324 --> 00:05:13.417 align:middle line:84%
Who is the counsel for the accused?

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Who is the counsel for the accused?

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Have you no lawyer
to defend your case?

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:38.890 align:middle line:90%
In that case, the government...
- My Lord.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:47.966 align:middle line:84%
I'm the counsel for the accused.

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:50.883 align:middle line:84%
I do not wish to defend myself.

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:58.507 align:middle line:90%
I promised to defend you,
if you're ever arraigned. Remember?

00:05:58.507 --> 00:06:06.577 align:middle line:84%
Does the accused give his consent?

00:06:06.577 --> 00:06:09.842 align:middle line:84%
Yes.

00:06:09.842 --> 00:06:16.768 align:middle line:90%
Raj, you have been accused of
a murderous attack on Judge Raghunath.

00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
You may plead your case.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:32.514 align:middle line:84%
I swear to speak the truth.

00:06:32.514 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Judge Raghunath, can you tell us
why the accused tried to kill you?

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.219 align:middle line:84%
Did he have any enmity with you?

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes. The grudge that a born
felon bears...

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.405 align:middle line:90%
against the judge who sentences
him and grants no reprieve.

00:06:52.405 --> 00:06:55.405 align:middle line:90%
Could there be no other reason
for such animosity?

00:06:55.405 --> 00:07:02.391 align:middle line:84%
None. How else could I relate to him?

00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I have no further questions.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:20.319 align:middle line:90%
Defense may proceed with
cross-questioning.

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:24.281 align:middle line:84%
Judge, you are senior to me.

00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:29.888 align:middle line:90%
If in the course of questioning,
I happen to affront you do forgive me.

00:07:29.888 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Someone's life is at stake.
And you have taught me...

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:42.690 align:middle line:90%
to ignore all relationships for
the dispensation of justice.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:52.145 align:middle line:90%
This is my first interrogation.
Please give me your blessings.

00:07:52.145 --> 00:07:57.187 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean when you call
the accused a born felon?

00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:59.645 align:middle line:84%
He has been a tramp and a hoodlum...

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:02.432 align:middle line:90%
ever since he was a child.
His record says it.

00:08:02.432 --> 00:08:07.121 align:middle line:90%
This penchant for crime has surely
been transmitted congenitally.

00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:09.144 align:middle line:84%
Judge, do you have any children?

00:08:09.144 --> 00:08:10.965 align:middle line:84%
No

00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:13.754 align:middle line:90%
But how is this question relevant
to this case?

00:08:13.754 --> 00:08:20.642 align:middle line:90%
Most relevant. Think again. Are you
certain that you have no children?

00:08:20.642 --> 00:08:25.789 align:middle line:90%
No. But I reiterate. This question...
- Can you recount the circumstance...

00:08:25.789 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:90%
when you threw your wife
out of your house?

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:35.256 align:middle line:90%
My Lord, am I to be forced to reply
to such meaningless questions?

00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:39.794 align:middle line:90%
Ms Rita, you may ask questions
relevant only to the case.

00:08:39.794 --> 00:08:43.491 align:middle line:90%
We wish to know whether or not,
the accused attempted murder.

00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:44.999 align:middle line:84%
If yes, then why?

00:08:44.999 --> 00:08:50.679 align:middle line:90%
Enough! Stop it! I'm a murderer!
Hang me if you will!

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:52.509 align:middle line:84%
Order! Order!

00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:54.814 align:middle line:84%
Proceed with your questioning.

00:08:54.814 --> 00:08:58.859 align:middle line:90%
The accused does not deny having
assaulted Judge Raghunath.

00:08:58.859 --> 00:09:04.277 align:middle line:90%
But, as you said just now,
the question is why he did it.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:90%
This interrogation is meant
to reveal the answer...

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:12.839 align:middle line:90%
if you my Lord, and Judge Raghunath
repose your trust in me for a while

00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:15.988 align:middle line:84%
You may proceed.

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:19.749 align:middle line:90%
I repeat my question.
Can you recount the circumstance...

00:09:19.749 --> 00:09:23.969 align:middle line:90%
when you threw your wife
out of your house?

00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I beg your pardon, Judge Raghunath,
but this question is very important.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And not only for the accused.
For you too.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.162 align:middle line:90%
The cause of whatever is happening
today, lies rooted in your past.

00:09:36.162 --> 00:09:39.109 align:middle line:84%
Remember?

00:09:39.109 --> 00:09:41.374 align:middle line:84%
Remember?

00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:46.332 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us? Why, when
and under what circumstance...

00:09:46.332 --> 00:09:49.499 align:middle line:90%
did you throw your wife
out of your house?

00:09:49.499 --> 00:09:52.259 align:middle line:84%
Why, when and under what circumstance...

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:55.415 align:middle line:90%
..did you throw your wife
out of your house?

00:09:55.415 --> 00:09:57.957 align:middle line:84%
Why, when and under what circumstance...

00:09:57.957 --> 00:10:01.937 align:middle line:90%
..did you throw your
wife out of your house?

00:10:01.937 --> 00:10:03.489 align:middle line:84%
24 years ago...

00:10:03.489 --> 00:10:05.485 align:middle line:84%
I was practicing law in Lucknow.

00:10:05.485 --> 00:10:10.564 align:middle line:90%
I was the black sheep of the family,
because I opposed social norm...

00:10:10.564 --> 00:10:14.884 align:middle line:90%
and I had married a widow.
My father was a big gun.

00:10:14.884 --> 00:10:18.249 align:middle line:90%
And was away in Bombay most of the time.
He was unhappy with me.

00:10:18.249 --> 00:10:21.392 align:middle line:90%
But under no circumstance,
was I willing to leave Leela.

00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:25.683 align:middle line:90%
She was so good to me.
She was such a good woman.

00:10:25.683 --> 00:10:29.858 align:middle line:84%
And I was in love with her.

00:10:29.858 --> 00:10:33.316 align:middle line:90%
But once, on our way from
Kanpur to Allahabad...

00:10:33.316 --> 00:10:35.753 align:middle line:90%
little did I realise that
like a boat in midstream...

00:10:35.753 --> 00:10:46.811 align:middle line:90%
my life too was to be caught
in cross currents.

00:10:46.811 --> 00:10:56.496 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:10:56.496 --> 00:10:58.953 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:10:58.953 --> 00:11:00.616 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.953 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:04.953 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
"I can't think straight."

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.116 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
"I can't think straight."

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.866 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:12.866 --> 00:11:15.328 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:11:15.328 --> 00:11:17.780 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.453 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:11:21.453 --> 00:11:30.660 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:84%
"The clear open sky over the head."

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.639 align:middle line:84%
"The clear open sky."

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:90%
"Be prudent, boatman.
There is storm in your boat."

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.546 align:middle line:84%
"There is storm in your boat."

00:11:48.546 --> 00:11:50.728 align:middle line:84%
"The deep capricious waves."

00:11:50.728 --> 00:11:52.647 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:52.647 --> 00:11:54.827 align:middle line:84%
"The deep capricious waves."

00:11:54.827 --> 00:11:56.534 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:56.534 --> 00:11:58.947 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:11:58.947 --> 00:12:00.617 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:00.617 --> 00:12:04.982 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:12:04.982 --> 00:12:13.482 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:20.358 align:middle line:84%
"A piece of the glass floats away."

00:12:20.358 --> 00:12:26.974 align:middle line:84%
"The iron too drowns."

00:12:26.974 --> 00:12:29.191 align:middle line:84%
"What are you thinking?"

00:12:29.191 --> 00:12:31.104 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:33.232 align:middle line:84%
"What are you thinking?"

00:12:33.232 --> 00:12:34.941 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:37.316 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:12:37.316 --> 00:12:38.979 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:38.979 --> 00:12:41.357 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:12:41.357 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.328 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:12:47.328 --> 00:13:29.767 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:40.542 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:13:40.542 --> 00:13:44.296 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you feeling sleepy?

00:13:44.296 --> 00:13:49.372 align:middle line:90%
What are you thinking about?
- Why do they sing "Beware"?

00:13:49.372 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:90%
They say, these parts are dangerous.
Jagga the bandit. He's from these parts.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Bandits?
- Yes, but don't worry.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.367 align:middle line:90%
As of now, he must be fast asleep
in some prison.

00:14:02.367 --> 00:14:10.232 align:middle line:84%
Go to bed. I'm feeling sleepy.

00:14:10.232 --> 00:14:18.134 align:middle line:90%
In case you're afraid, I can come over.
- No.

00:14:18.134 --> 00:14:26.204 align:middle line:84%
Leela!

00:14:26.204 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:84%
No! The lady is with them!

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:13.709 align:middle line:84%
Leave me! Leave me! Leave me!

00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:17.810 align:middle line:84%
You heartless bandits!

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.187 align:middle line:84%
Where's your chief?

00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:25.613 align:middle line:90%
What right have you to terrorise
women from good families?

00:15:25.613 --> 00:15:27.905 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you ashamed?
- Ashamed?

00:15:27.905 --> 00:15:31.155 align:middle line:90%
Shame is for good folks,
not for bandits and robbers.

00:15:31.155 --> 00:15:37.405 align:middle line:90%
As for me, my grandfather was a bandit,
my father was a bandit! But I wasn't.

00:15:37.405 --> 00:15:42.405 align:middle line:90%
And your husband went and made me one!
- My husband?

00:15:42.405 --> 00:15:46.448 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?
- Jagga. And I was innocent.

00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:51.822 align:middle line:90%
But without a shard of evidence,
your husband framed me...

00:15:51.822 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:90%
just because my father, my grandfather
were bandits.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.501 align:middle line:90%
He framed me for rape
and he sent me to jail.

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:07.905 align:middle line:90%
So I've decided to prove
your husband right.

00:16:07.905 --> 00:16:15.542 align:middle line:84%
Coward!

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:19.516 align:middle line:84%
See what's wrong with her.

00:16:19.516 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Has she come to her senses?

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.277 align:middle line:84%
No, she's still in a swoon.

00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:32.779 align:middle line:90%
Let her go, Chief. She's pregnant.
She's going to become a mother.

00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Touch her, and you go to hell.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:43.279 align:middle line:84%
Pregnant? With a baby?

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:50.818 align:middle line:90%
Her husband said that children born
of good folks turn out good.

00:16:50.818 --> 00:16:54.231 align:middle line:84%
And children born of bandits...

00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:58.482 align:middle line:84%
turn out to be bandits. Always.

00:16:58.482 --> 00:17:06.234 align:middle line:90%
Now let's see what the lawyer's son
turns out to be.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:11.284 align:middle line:84%
Send her back once she recovers.

00:17:11.284 --> 00:17:24.604 align:middle line:90%
Good are those born of good folks!
And of bandits are bandits born.

00:17:24.604 --> 00:17:27.558 align:middle line:90%
You should make me a gift.
- What's the occasion?

00:17:27.558 --> 00:17:30.965 align:middle line:90%
Not any occasion.
The lady is back.

00:17:30.965 --> 00:17:34.558 align:middle line:84%
What did you say? The lady?

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:37.501 align:middle line:84%
Leela!

00:17:37.501 --> 00:17:42.225 align:middle line:84%
Leela!

00:17:42.225 --> 00:17:44.101 align:middle line:84%
Why is it dark in here?

00:17:44.101 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Nathu! Bansi! Naina!

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:51.472 align:middle line:84%
Lights! Tonight we celebrate!

00:17:51.472 --> 00:17:52.808 align:middle line:84%
Leela.

00:17:52.808 --> 00:17:57.725 align:middle line:84%
It is you who lights up my life.

00:17:57.725 --> 00:18:06.973 align:middle line:84%
Leela.

00:18:06.973 --> 00:18:10.791 align:middle line:90%
Now that you're back,
even the lights seem so bright!

00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:19.809 align:middle line:84%
Give me the wick.

00:18:19.809 --> 00:18:26.987 align:middle line:90%
But Leela, how did you escape?
I hope you weren't in danger?

00:18:26.987 --> 00:18:33.682 align:middle line:90%
Your love was with me.
How could anyone even look up at me?

00:18:33.682 --> 00:18:44.581 align:middle line:90%
You are tired. Change.
I'll bring you your dressing gown.

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:51.162 align:middle line:84%
These last four days.

00:18:51.162 --> 00:18:55.922 align:middle line:90%
The last four days were
like a lifetime.

00:18:55.922 --> 00:18:58.695 align:middle line:90%
I took the police and I looked
everywhere for you.

00:18:58.695 --> 00:19:11.125 align:middle line:84%
All the while, I feared...

00:19:11.125 --> 00:19:22.554 align:middle line:84%
I feared you were in grave danger!

00:19:22.554 --> 00:19:28.262 align:middle line:90%
But how did you escape?
And who was this bandit?

00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:32.493 align:middle line:90%
Some Jagga.
He said that you had convicted him.

00:19:32.493 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Jagga.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:41.748 align:middle line:90%
So he escaped to get even with me!
If he has done anything to you...

00:19:41.748 --> 00:19:46.429 align:middle line:90%
I'll see to it that he hangs!
- At heart, he's a devil.

00:19:46.429 --> 00:19:51.409 align:middle line:90%
But God saved me at the last moment.
Thank God!

00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:55.319 align:middle line:84%
Tell me something.

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Ask.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.652 align:middle line:90%
Does a bandit's son necessarily
become a bandit?

00:20:02.652 --> 00:20:08.264 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's bound to happen.

00:20:08.264 --> 00:20:22.503 align:middle line:90%
But why do you ask?
- Just like that.

00:20:22.503 --> 00:20:27.419 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what comes first.
Your becoming a magistrate, or...

00:20:27.419 --> 00:20:31.782 align:middle line:84%
Why? Is someone expected?

00:20:31.782 --> 00:20:34.211 align:middle line:84%
A new guest.

00:20:34.211 --> 00:20:39.137 align:middle line:90%
Now I don't have any chances
of becoming a magistrate.

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:42.503 align:middle line:84%
Why? What happened?

00:20:42.503 --> 00:20:52.753 align:middle line:90%
Whatever...
let's talk of something else.

00:20:52.753 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:84%
How do you like this?

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.306 align:middle line:84%
Nice.

00:20:58.306 --> 00:21:00.566 align:middle line:84%
Nice.

00:21:00.566 --> 00:21:07.378 align:middle line:90%
Listen...
Are you annoyed with me?

00:21:07.378 --> 00:21:11.336 align:middle line:84%
Annoyed? No.

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:17.211 align:middle line:84%
Why should I be annoyed with you?

00:21:17.211 --> 00:21:28.285 align:middle line:84%
Have my lunch sent over.

00:21:28.285 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:90%
What's the matter?
Where are the servants?

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.196 align:middle line:90%
God knows! Maybe they're all dead!
I have to do all the chores.

00:21:34.196 --> 00:21:36.655 align:middle line:90%
Let me help you.
- You'd rather tell her all this.

00:21:36.655 --> 00:21:40.363 align:middle line:84%
She's sitting around like a queen!

00:21:40.363 --> 00:21:44.815 align:middle line:90%
Not to be cross with Leela.
I told her not to strain herself.

00:21:44.815 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:90%
You know the condition she is in.
And in a few days from now...

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:54.613 align:middle line:90%
She's going to bear the fruit
of her sins!

00:21:54.613 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:90%
What are you saying?!
- What everyone else is saying!

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:03.239 align:middle line:90%
For four days, she lived with a bandit!
And Jagga that!

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:07.363 align:middle line:90%
Don't you remember what
he was convicted for?

00:22:07.363 --> 00:22:10.405 align:middle line:90%
Do you enjoy making someone unhappy?
The jaundiced eye sees all yellow.

00:22:10.405 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you think you're beyond scrutiny?
Don't you forget...

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.193 align:middle line:90%
women have had to stand the test of
chastity. Because society asks for it.

00:22:16.193 --> 00:22:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Bhabhi! (Sister-in-law)

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.242 align:middle line:90%
Forgive me Bhabhi,
your pot is broken.

00:22:25.242 --> 00:22:29.860 align:middle line:90%
It's only an earthen pot. But remember,
a woman's honour is far more fragile.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:23:00.259 align:middle line:90%
Once disgraced, her honour
can never be redeemed.

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:03.789 align:middle line:84%
Just answer my question!

00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Did you not know that your wife
was seeing her lover on the sly?

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.300 align:middle line:90%
The villagers used to say that.
But I didn't heed what they said.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.295 align:middle line:90%
You haven't yet told the court
why your wife deserted you.

00:23:14.295 --> 00:23:29.296 align:middle line:90%
You know it! Women are adulterous!
- I know what that means!

00:23:29.296 --> 00:23:34.186 align:middle line:90%
Raghu, how can you lose
your cool in court?

00:23:34.186 --> 00:23:39.307 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid your chances of
magistrate ship may be clouded.

00:23:39.307 --> 00:23:47.878 align:middle line:90%
Chances of a magistrate ship?
That's out of question now.

00:23:47.878 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Can a lawyer whose wife is under
suspicion ever become a magistrate?

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.823 align:middle line:84%
Raghu!

00:23:53.823 --> 00:23:57.352 align:middle line:90%
The whole town is agog!
- What are you saying?

00:23:57.352 --> 00:24:01.364 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you ashamed to talk like this
about your wife?

00:24:01.364 --> 00:24:04.391 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying what everyone is saying.

00:24:04.391 --> 00:24:08.281 align:middle line:84%
Let them say what they want.

00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
You're right. That's what I decided.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.129 align:middle line:84%
Let them say what they want.

00:24:17.129 --> 00:24:23.318 align:middle line:90%
But how do I get rid of the suspicion?
It's like a leech sucking on...

00:24:23.318 --> 00:24:45.465 align:middle line:90%
some dark corner of my mind!
- What now?

00:24:45.465 --> 00:24:50.314 align:middle line:84%
Nathu! Naina! Bhabhi!

00:24:50.314 --> 00:24:53.903 align:middle line:84%
Where's everyone?

00:24:53.903 --> 00:24:59.138 align:middle line:84%
Send Bhabhi over to me.

00:24:59.138 --> 00:25:02.979 align:middle line:84%
I am scared.

00:25:02.979 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't someone coming to me?

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:15.337 align:middle line:90%
That's my husband.
Please, send him over to me.

00:25:15.337 --> 00:25:18.645 align:middle line:84%
Look Raghu...

00:25:18.645 --> 00:25:21.346 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you again! That baby
isn't going to be born in this house

00:25:21.346 --> 00:25:24.593 align:middle line:90%
If she wants to have her bastard,
let her go elsewhere.

00:25:24.593 --> 00:25:27.223 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to let the honour
of my family be tainted.

00:25:27.223 --> 00:25:30.131 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to throw this
wanton woman out!

00:25:30.131 --> 00:25:34.288 align:middle line:90%
No! I'm not going anywhere!
No one can take me away from here!

00:25:34.288 --> 00:25:45.698 align:middle line:90%
He knows that I'm innocent!
He trusts me, he trusts me!

00:25:45.698 --> 00:25:50.379 align:middle line:84%
You're here! Now I'm afraid of no one!

00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:54.173 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard?
They want to throw me out!

00:25:54.173 --> 00:26:00.296 align:middle line:90%
They say I'm a wanton woman!
They say, I've no right to be here!

00:26:00.296 --> 00:26:05.575 align:middle line:90%
But now you're here.
No one will dare anymore.

00:26:05.575 --> 00:26:12.669 align:middle line:90%
Tell them I'm untainted!
Tell them you trust me.

00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:34.708 align:middle line:84%
Tell them I'm mothering your child.

00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Have you fallen for what they say?

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:90%
You're the one who told me...
I don't care for the barking dogs.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:50.269 align:middle line:90%
If you desert me, who else
in this world can I turn to?

00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:55.668 align:middle line:84%
Tell me... tell me that you trust me!

00:26:55.668 --> 00:26:57.885 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you're above scrutiny?

00:26:57.885 --> 00:27:15.536 align:middle line:90%
Don't you forget women have
had to stand the test of chastity.

00:27:15.536 --> 00:27:21.449 align:middle line:90%
Why are you quiet?
Speak... speak!

00:27:21.449 --> 00:27:28.444 align:middle line:90%
You can see the state I'm in.
I'm afraid... afraid!

00:27:28.444 --> 00:27:35.163 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to become a mother
...the mother of your child.

00:27:35.163 --> 00:27:41.199 align:middle line:90%
Have mercy! This is your baby.
This baby is yours!

00:27:41.199 --> 00:27:58.266 align:middle line:90%
Get out!
Get out of here!

00:27:58.266 --> 00:28:08.598 align:middle line:84%
"A dutiful wife like Sita."

00:28:08.598 --> 00:28:14.801 align:middle line:84%
"You gave exile to her."

00:28:14.801 --> 00:28:25.610 align:middle line:84%
"Why didn't the earth rip apart?"

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:30.955 align:middle line:84%
"Why didn't the sky rip apart?"

00:28:30.955 --> 00:28:35.202 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:28:35.202 --> 00:28:39.852 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:28:39.852 --> 00:28:43.461 align:middle line:84%
"The dear one of Lord Rama."

00:28:43.461 --> 00:28:47.464 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:28:47.464 --> 00:28:51.381 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:55.381 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:59.857 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:28:59.857 --> 00:29:03.985 align:middle line:84%
"Look, the King of the palace."

00:29:03.985 --> 00:29:07.131 align:middle line:84%
"What a game is he playing!"

00:29:07.131 --> 00:29:21.690 align:middle line:84%
"What a game is he playing!"

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.928 align:middle line:84%
"Look, the King of the palace."

00:29:25.928 --> 00:29:28.941 align:middle line:84%
"What a game is he playing!"

00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:32.765 align:middle line:84%
"What a game is he playing!"

00:29:32.765 --> 00:29:36.964 align:middle line:90%
"From the shell, a pearl,
and in the muck."

00:29:36.964 --> 00:29:40.698 align:middle line:84%
"The beautiful lotus is blossoming."

00:29:40.698 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
"The beautiful lotus is blossoming."

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:52.169 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:29:52.169 --> 00:29:56.735 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:29:56.735 --> 00:30:00.113 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:30:00.113 --> 00:30:05.561 align:middle line:90%
"Congratulations, Lawyer!
A son has born to you."

00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:12.412 align:middle line:90%
Son of a decent family!
Born in a filthy gutter!

00:30:12.412 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.616 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:30:19.616 --> 00:30:23.158 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:30:23.158 --> 00:30:25.533 align:middle line:90%
Do you not know what your wife
and your son went through...

00:30:25.533 --> 00:30:28.998 align:middle line:90%
after you shut your doors on them?
- No

00:30:28.998 --> 00:30:32.296 align:middle line:84%
Nor did you try to find out.

00:30:32.296 --> 00:30:35.322 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you.

00:30:35.322 --> 00:30:40.316 align:middle line:90%
To get out of your way,
your wife left Lucknow.

00:30:40.316 --> 00:30:46.108 align:middle line:90%
And your innocent son grew up
in a Bombay slum.

00:30:46.108 --> 00:30:57.274 align:middle line:84%
One day...

00:30:57.274 --> 00:31:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Police! Scram!

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:11.511 align:middle line:84%
Greetings, sir.

00:31:11.511 --> 00:31:15.205 align:middle line:90%
Hey Nathu...
- Hello, Constable.

00:31:15.205 --> 00:31:18.355 align:middle line:90%
What are you up there like a monkey?
Why don't you go to school?

00:31:18.355 --> 00:31:22.878 align:middle line:84%
At school, the master asks for fees.

00:31:22.878 --> 00:31:27.830 align:middle line:90%
My father hasn't the money
to send me to school.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.241 align:middle line:90%
Look at Leela's son, Raj.
He lives in this slum too.

00:31:30.241 --> 00:31:35.748 align:middle line:90%
His mother is worse off. Yet she
sends her boy to such a big school.

00:31:35.748 --> 00:31:42.229 align:middle line:90%
What did you say? He isn't a boy.
He's a sissy!

00:31:42.229 --> 00:31:47.624 align:middle line:90%
Ma, why do you put oil in my hair?
- Oil keeps the hair soft.

00:31:47.624 --> 00:31:50.325 align:middle line:90%
But why do boys in the
neighbourhood call me sissy?

00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:54.161 align:middle line:90%
So what?
How do they compare with you?

00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:56.809 align:middle line:90%
You're a good boy
who goes to school.

00:31:56.809 --> 00:31:59.299 align:middle line:90%
You'll grow up to become
an educated man.

00:31:59.299 --> 00:32:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And those vagabonds will go to jail.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Mother, who are called vagabonds?

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.733 align:middle line:84%
The ones who just tramp around.

00:32:09.733 --> 00:32:12.266 align:middle line:90%
Those who think that whatever
belongs to others, belongs to them.

00:32:12.266 --> 00:32:16.304 align:middle line:90%
Those who gamble and drink
instead of going to school.

00:32:16.304 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And they have fun!

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.874 align:middle line:90%
Ma, when I grow up,
I'll become vagabond too.

00:32:21.874 --> 00:32:28.976 align:middle line:84%
Nonsense! You'll become a lawyer.

00:32:28.976 --> 00:32:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Then a magistrate.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, a judge.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.265 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:32:35.265 --> 00:32:38.279 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:42.788 align:middle line:90%
You're sitting here?
Everyone's out there buying chocolates.

00:32:42.788 --> 00:32:44.847 align:middle line:84%
I don't have money

00:32:44.847 --> 00:32:47.386 align:middle line:90%
Why, doesn't your mother
give you money?

00:32:47.386 --> 00:32:50.399 align:middle line:84%
Daddy gives me a whole Rupee every day!

00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:52.763 align:middle line:84%
You're rich. And I'm poor.

00:32:52.763 --> 00:32:55.452 align:middle line:90%
Eat this
- No.

00:32:55.452 --> 00:32:57.472 align:middle line:90%
Ma says never ask
for anything to eat.

00:32:57.472 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:90%
If she told you not to ask,
go ahead and snatch it.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.453 align:middle line:84%
Wild!

00:33:04.453 --> 00:33:07.957 align:middle line:90%
Wild?
- No, no, no.

00:33:07.957 --> 00:33:10.552 align:middle line:90%
You're coming to my place
this evening, aren't you?

00:33:10.552 --> 00:33:13.518 align:middle line:90%
Why, what's happening?
- My birthday party!

00:33:13.518 --> 00:33:15.254 align:middle line:84%
You must come! It's going to be fun!

00:33:15.254 --> 00:33:20.136 align:middle line:90%
You know, Daddy has ordered
such a huge cake!

00:33:20.136 --> 00:33:23.552 align:middle line:84%
Happy birthday to you!

00:33:23.552 --> 00:33:32.706 align:middle line:84%
Happy birthday to you!

00:33:32.706 --> 00:33:34.799 align:middle line:84%
Happy birthday to you!

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:36.997 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

00:33:36.997 --> 00:33:49.176 align:middle line:84%
Let's go and eat ice cream.

00:33:49.176 --> 00:33:53.259 align:middle line:84%
Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?

00:33:53.259 --> 00:33:57.509 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have money to buy anything.
I'll give you some other time.

00:33:57.509 --> 00:34:01.704 align:middle line:90%
Must you only buy something
to make a gift?

00:34:01.704 --> 00:34:12.402 align:middle line:90%
You can give me a flower.
- Really?

00:34:12.402 --> 00:34:14.734 align:middle line:84%
Here you are.

00:34:14.734 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Someday, I'm going to make
lots of money.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:22.275 align:middle line:90%
And I'll buy a gift for you.
Something better than all this.

00:34:22.275 --> 00:34:24.192 align:middle line:84%
Do that.

00:34:24.192 --> 00:34:26.688 align:middle line:90%
But can anything be better
than this flower?

00:34:26.688 --> 00:34:30.109 align:middle line:90%
Ritu! Ritu! Your father
is calling you! - Coming!

00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Come on Raj, meet my father.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
You always say this.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.734 align:middle line:84%
Ritu, say hello to the Judge"

00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:47.161 align:middle line:84%
Hello, Judge.

00:34:47.161 --> 00:34:49.237 align:middle line:84%
Bless you.

00:34:49.237 --> 00:34:55.283 align:middle line:90%
You've grown up in these four years
You must've forgotten me.

00:34:55.283 --> 00:34:57.594 align:middle line:84%
Happy birthday

00:34:57.594 --> 00:35:03.816 align:middle line:90%
I've just arrived from Lucknow.
I owe you a present.

00:35:03.816 --> 00:35:09.158 align:middle line:84%
As of now, I can give you a flower.

00:35:09.158 --> 00:35:15.887 align:middle line:84%
Here you are.

00:35:15.887 --> 00:35:19.532 align:middle line:84%
Let me put it on your hair.

00:35:19.532 --> 00:35:22.143 align:middle line:90%
Someone has already put a flower
over there.

00:35:22.143 --> 00:35:24.705 align:middle line:84%
Raj has given me this flower

00:35:24.705 --> 00:35:28.356 align:middle line:90%
Daddy, this is Raj.
He's in my class.

00:35:28.356 --> 00:35:30.540 align:middle line:90%
I see.
- Hello.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:34.221 align:middle line:90%
Hello.
- Hello.

00:35:34.221 --> 00:35:37.224 align:middle line:84%
God bless you, son"

00:35:37.224 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Raj says that he will become a judge
when he grows up.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:44.136 align:middle line:84%
Very good!

00:35:44.136 --> 00:35:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Your father must be a real gentleman.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.563 align:middle line:84%
What does your father do?

00:35:49.563 --> 00:35:54.968 align:middle line:90%
I don't have my father.
I have only my mother

00:35:54.968 --> 00:35:57.851 align:middle line:90%
Has he passed away?
- No! Don't say that!

00:35:57.851 --> 00:36:03.523 align:middle line:90%
My mother says he is alive.
But...

00:36:03.523 --> 00:36:08.716 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't live with you
...and you haven't seen him either?

00:36:08.716 --> 00:36:12.795 align:middle line:90%
Your father is a strange man.
- Not a word about my father.

00:36:12.795 --> 00:36:16.724 align:middle line:84%
Else... else...

00:36:16.724 --> 00:36:21.657 align:middle line:90%
Raj!
- Rita!

00:36:21.657 --> 00:36:26.472 align:middle line:90%
How can you let your daughter
play with boys like him?

00:36:26.472 --> 00:36:28.781 align:middle line:84%
Go to play, Ritu"

00:36:28.781 --> 00:36:33.753 align:middle line:90%
Why, what's wrong with the boy?
I like him.

00:36:33.753 --> 00:36:38.546 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't even know his father's
name, and you like him?

00:36:38.546 --> 00:36:40.940 align:middle line:90%
I'd say he's just a wastrel
- Forget it.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:44.958 align:middle line:90%
Must you hang on to
those rotten old ideas?

00:36:44.958 --> 00:36:47.619 align:middle line:84%
What was the Bandit's name?

00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:49.329 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Jagga.

00:36:49.329 --> 00:36:53.265 align:middle line:90%
I remember you saying the same
at his trial.

00:36:53.265 --> 00:36:57.653 align:middle line:90%
That a bandit's son
always becomes a bandit.

00:36:57.653 --> 00:36:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I still stand by that principle.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:04.482 align:middle line:90%
Principles, principles and principles!
It's because of these blind dogmas...

00:37:04.482 --> 00:37:07.357 align:middle line:90%
that you lost someone
as precious as Leela.

00:37:07.357 --> 00:37:10.155 align:middle line:90%
And because of your principles,
you never married again.

00:37:10.155 --> 00:37:13.198 align:middle line:90%
The dry parched desert that
your life is, is your own doing.

00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:14.604 align:middle line:90%
So much so that you would rather
destroy a friendship...

00:37:14.604 --> 00:37:17.395 align:middle line:90%
between two innocent children?
Why, what has the poor child done...

00:37:17.395 --> 00:37:21.221 align:middle line:84%
to bring you to harm?

00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:23.178 align:middle line:84%
Not this boy. But it was...

00:37:23.178 --> 00:37:29.615 align:middle line:90%
someone like him who destroyed my life
...and brought me to disgrace.

00:37:29.615 --> 00:37:32.448 align:middle line:90%
Maybe today, he too says
what this boy just said...

00:37:32.448 --> 00:37:38.326 align:middle line:90%
I'm only my mother's son
...I have no father.

00:37:38.326 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:84%
In every urchin I see him...

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.586 align:middle line:90%
the one whom my wife bore,
the one who isn't mine.

00:37:46.586 --> 00:37:51.876 align:middle line:84%
My wife's, yet not mine.

00:37:51.876 --> 00:37:54.278 align:middle line:90%
Rita looks good in that photo,
doesn't she?

00:37:54.278 --> 00:37:57.943 align:middle line:90%
But Ma, why do you work so hard?
This is why you fall ill.

00:37:57.943 --> 00:38:00.859 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to let you work
anymore, you understand?

00:38:00.859 --> 00:38:04.985 align:middle line:90%
You mad boy! If I don't work,
how are we going to eat?

00:38:04.985 --> 00:38:07.517 align:middle line:90%
I'm a man. I'm the one
who is going to work.

00:38:07.517 --> 00:38:09.699 align:middle line:84%
From tomorrow, no going to school!

00:38:09.699 --> 00:38:13.963 align:middle line:90%
You won't go to school?
Won't you?

00:38:13.963 --> 00:38:16.212 align:middle line:90%
How will you become a gentleman,
unless you educate yourself?

00:38:16.212 --> 00:38:20.700 align:middle line:90%
You want to be a vagabond!
- Mother!

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:25.959 align:middle line:90%
Without schooling, how can you become
a lawyer, a magistrate, a judge?

00:38:25.959 --> 00:38:34.131 align:middle line:90%
If you say so, I'll go to school
...and I'll work too.

00:38:34.131 --> 00:38:38.900 align:middle line:90%
But I won't become a judge.
At Rita's I met a judge.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:39:02.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't like him.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:10.476 align:middle line:90%
"Go for a stroll, those
who are going."

00:39:10.476 --> 00:39:15.170 align:middle line:90%
"Go for a stroll, those
who are going."

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:18.445 align:middle line:84%
"Since when we have been waiting,

00:39:18.445 --> 00:39:23.508 align:middle line:84%
we cobblers."

00:39:23.508 --> 00:39:28.633 align:middle line:84%
Page 120.

00:39:28.633 --> 00:39:29.938 align:middle line:84%
Raj.

00:39:29.938 --> 00:39:32.642 align:middle line:90%
Good morning, teacher.
Sorry, I'm late.

00:39:32.642 --> 00:39:36.300 align:middle line:90%
I work, you know. I work
- What's all this?

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:41.716 align:middle line:84%
Brush, wax... I give you a good polish.

00:39:41.716 --> 00:39:44.767 align:middle line:90%
Your name has been struck
from the rolls.

00:39:44.767 --> 00:39:47.500 align:middle line:90%
What?
- You can't study here anymore.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:52.666 align:middle line:90%
But I've brought the fees too! If you
say so, I'll stop polishing boots.

00:39:52.666 --> 00:40:01.215 align:middle line:84%
Silence!

00:40:01.215 --> 00:40:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So I can't study here any longer, can I?

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.361 align:middle line:84%
No.

00:40:06.361 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:90%
For a minute, can I talk to Rita?
I have a gift for her.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:28.512 align:middle line:90%
Rita's father has transferred her
out of this school. They have moved.

00:40:28.512 --> 00:40:31.356 align:middle line:84%
Why did you kick my ball?

00:40:31.356 --> 00:40:33.714 align:middle line:84%
Forgive me, I stepped on it by mistake.

00:40:33.714 --> 00:40:38.690 align:middle line:90%
How dare a boot-polish-boy?
- Hit him!

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.633 align:middle line:84%
Beat him! Beat him!

00:40:40.633 --> 00:40:44.133 align:middle line:90%
You're just a boot-polish boy.
You dare take me on?

00:40:44.133 --> 00:40:46.925 align:middle line:84%
Beat him! Beat him!

00:40:46.925 --> 00:40:48.428 align:middle line:84%
Hit him!

00:40:48.428 --> 00:40:54.472 align:middle line:84%
His coat... strip him!

00:40:54.472 --> 00:40:56.928 align:middle line:84%
Hit him!

00:40:56.928 --> 00:41:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Beat him! Beat him!

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Beat him! Beat him!

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.763 align:middle line:84%
Beat him! Beat him!

00:41:07.763 --> 00:41:10.512 align:middle line:90%
My Ma is ill.
Let me go to my Ma.

00:41:10.512 --> 00:41:14.475 align:middle line:90%
You can hit me some other time.
My Ma is ill. Let me go to my Ma.

00:41:14.475 --> 00:41:16.429 align:middle line:90%
Your Ma is ill?
- Yes

00:41:16.429 --> 00:41:20.994 align:middle line:84%
His Ma is ill!

00:41:20.994 --> 00:41:23.801 align:middle line:84%
Run! Uncle Jagga is here! Run!

00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:47.825 align:middle line:84%
Run! Uncle Jagga is here! Run!

00:41:47.825 --> 00:41:55.588 align:middle line:84%
Get up. Come with me.

00:41:55.588 --> 00:41:58.113 align:middle line:90%
Where to?
- Wherever I go.

00:41:58.113 --> 00:42:01.569 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you go wherever I go.

00:42:01.569 --> 00:42:04.640 align:middle line:84%
That's what your father wanted.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.895 align:middle line:90%
You know my father?
- Yes.

00:42:07.895 --> 00:42:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I knew him.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:18.285 align:middle line:90%
Whatever I am today,
is all thanks to him.

00:42:18.285 --> 00:42:21.593 align:middle line:84%
I owe your Dad an old debt.

00:42:21.593 --> 00:42:23.768 align:middle line:90%
Then you'll surely help me
find a job somewhere?

00:42:23.768 --> 00:42:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Job? What job?
- Whatever! I'll do anything!

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.246 align:middle line:90%
My Ma is sick! We haven't anything
to eat! Give me any job!

00:42:31.246 --> 00:42:34.263 align:middle line:90%
I'll clean the dishes, sweep floors,
carry luggage... I'll do anything!

00:42:34.263 --> 00:42:38.663 align:middle line:84%
Just give me a job! Give me a job!

00:42:38.663 --> 00:42:41.637 align:middle line:84%
You fool! Only fools work.

00:42:41.637 --> 00:42:44.645 align:middle line:90%
You're a smart boy.
And you talk of working?

00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:48.287 align:middle line:90%
Unless I work, how will I eat?
How will I feed my mother?

00:42:48.287 --> 00:43:00.946 align:middle line:90%
Steal
- Steal?

00:43:00.946 --> 00:43:13.555 align:middle line:84%
Stealing... no!

00:43:13.555 --> 00:43:17.427 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes!
Steal! Steal! Steal!

00:43:17.427 --> 00:43:32.555 align:middle line:84%
Pick pockets, locks, rob, kill.

00:43:32.555 --> 00:43:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:39.739 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.972 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:43:45.972 --> 00:43:49.400 align:middle line:84%
You took so long, son.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.347 align:middle line:90%
You've been hungry all day.
Go on, eat food.

00:43:53.347 --> 00:43:57.971 align:middle line:90%
Food? Have you cooked?
- Yes, why not?

00:43:57.971 --> 00:44:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It's over there, under the plate.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.692 align:middle line:90%
The bread is warm.
I even cooked potatoes.

00:44:04.692 --> 00:44:17.733 align:middle line:84%
Take some. It's on the shelf.

00:44:17.733 --> 00:44:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Have you found it?

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:28.365 align:middle line:84%
Yes Ma, I found it.

00:44:28.365 --> 00:44:34.666 align:middle line:84%
The bread, and potatoes too.

00:44:34.666 --> 00:44:38.479 align:middle line:84%
The potatoes are delicious.

00:44:38.479 --> 00:44:45.713 align:middle line:90%
Eat it then. Give me a bread too.
I'm very hungry.

00:44:45.713 --> 00:44:49.703 align:middle line:90%
Very hungry.
- Bread?

00:44:49.703 --> 00:44:53.947 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Ma. I'll get it right now.

00:44:53.947 --> 00:45:00.532 align:middle line:84%
Right now.

00:45:00.532 --> 00:45:04.129 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes!
Steal! Steal! Steal!

00:45:04.129 --> 00:45:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Pick pockets, locks, rob, kill.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.490 align:middle line:84%
You thief!

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.942 align:middle line:90%
Stealing bread?
- Excuse me, my Ma is hungry.

00:45:32.942 --> 00:45:35.199 align:middle line:90%
She hasn't had anything to eat
in three days

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:43.315 align:middle line:84%
Son of a gun! Off you go to the cops!

00:45:43.315 --> 00:45:47.136 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?
I asked you what's your name?

00:45:47.136 --> 00:45:48.327 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:45:48.327 --> 00:45:50.183 align:middle line:84%
Father's name?

00:45:50.183 --> 00:45:52.758 align:middle line:90%
Ma has never told me
my father's name.

00:45:52.758 --> 00:45:56.165 align:middle line:90%
Where does your mother live?
I asked you where your mother lives.

00:45:56.165 --> 00:45:59.332 align:middle line:84%
I won't tell you. I won't.

00:45:59.332 --> 00:46:02.966 align:middle line:90%
If you don't, who pays for your bail?
You'll go to jail. You know that?

00:46:02.966 --> 00:46:11.405 align:middle line:84%
Jail!

00:46:11.405 --> 00:46:13.405 align:middle line:90%
Where are you running?
- Don't send me to jail!

00:46:13.405 --> 00:46:15.613 align:middle line:90%
My Ma is hungry.
Don't send me to jail!

00:46:15.613 --> 00:46:22.109 align:middle line:90%
My Ma is hungry.
Don't send me to jail!

00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:28.154 align:middle line:90%
Afraid, son? Don't be.
This is just your first step.

00:46:28.154 --> 00:47:18.451 align:middle line:84%
The road ahead is very long.

00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Hey, are you mad?

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.743 align:middle line:84%
Why are you laughing at your bread?

00:47:24.743 --> 00:47:28.660 align:middle line:84%
This bread...

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.826 align:middle line:90%
you know this bread?
She makes you dance.

00:47:31.826 --> 00:47:35.273 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?
- She made me dance!

00:47:35.273 --> 00:47:40.208 align:middle line:90%
Outside the jail twelve years ago,
had I found her...

00:47:40.208 --> 00:47:43.285 align:middle line:90%
would I be here time and again,
for her sake?

00:47:43.285 --> 00:47:47.810 align:middle line:90%
You've had enough for free.
Come on, the jailer is calling you.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:50.868 align:middle line:90%
Your time's up. Find yourself
some other hotel.

00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:51.948 align:middle line:90%
Time is over?
- Yes.

00:47:51.948 --> 00:47:54.618 align:middle line:90%
Okay, boss! I don't like
the food of this place!

00:47:54.618 --> 00:47:56.323 align:middle line:84%
Now I will eat in Taj Mahal Hotel.

00:47:56.323 --> 00:47:59.785 align:middle line:90%
If you want to eat at
the Taj Mahal Hotel, stop thieving.

00:47:59.785 --> 00:48:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, boss.
- Stop picking pockets.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.451 align:middle line:90%
Yes, boss.
- And do some honest work.

00:48:04.451 --> 00:48:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Sure. I'm going on a pilgrimage.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:33.701 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

00:48:33.701 --> 00:48:39.502 align:middle line:90%
"In troubled times, I am
the star in the sky."

00:48:39.502 --> 00:48:44.992 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

00:48:44.992 --> 00:48:50.740 align:middle line:90%
"In troubled times,
I am the star in the sky."

00:48:50.740 --> 00:49:07.237 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond."

00:49:07.237 --> 00:49:10.200 align:middle line:84%
"I don't have a house or a family."

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:18.118 align:middle line:84%
"Nobody loves me. Nobody loves me."

00:49:18.118 --> 00:49:22.201 align:middle line:90%
"There is no promise of meeting
someone from across."

00:49:22.201 --> 00:49:27.701 align:middle line:84%
"Nobody loves me. Nobody loves me."

00:49:27.701 --> 00:49:33.226 align:middle line:90%
"I'm the beloved of isolated
and alien places."

00:49:33.226 --> 00:49:38.610 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:44.760 align:middle line:90%
"In troubled times, I am
the star in the sky."

00:49:44.760 --> 00:50:02.460 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond."

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.870 align:middle line:90%
"I'm not flourishing,
I am not ruined."

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:07.623 align:middle line:84%
"Still I sing happy songs."

00:50:07.623 --> 00:50:11.661 align:middle line:84%
"Still I sing happy songs."

00:50:11.661 --> 00:50:14.484 align:middle line:84%
"My heart is filled with wounds."

00:50:14.484 --> 00:50:20.220 align:middle line:84%
"But still these lively eyes smile."

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:25.781 align:middle line:84%
"World.."

00:50:25.781 --> 00:50:35.430 align:middle line:90%
"World, I am troubled by your
sorrows or misfortunes."

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:40.497 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

00:50:40.497 --> 00:50:46.210 align:middle line:90%
"In troubled times, I am
the star in the sky."

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:51.462 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

00:50:51.462 --> 00:51:19.671 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond."

00:51:19.671 --> 00:51:24.277 align:middle line:84%
Hands up!

00:51:24.277 --> 00:51:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Raj! Raj!

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.275 align:middle line:84%
Raj! You had me scared.

00:51:32.275 --> 00:51:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Come on, give me a hug.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:40.897 align:middle line:84%
Well boss, how is business?

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:44.587 align:middle line:90%
Hey, are you talking English?
- This time in jail...

00:51:44.587 --> 00:51:49.343 align:middle line:90%
I came across one of the politicos.
I thought I'd make the most of it.

00:51:49.343 --> 00:51:50.418 align:middle line:84%
I could use it.

00:51:50.418 --> 00:51:53.132 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, what news of Ma?
You told her, didn't you?

00:51:53.132 --> 00:51:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes, a long time ago. She thinks
you're away on a long business trip...

00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:05.110 align:middle line:90%
with your boss. When you go home,
you must go home in style.

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:08.644 align:middle line:90%
I have it all fixed.
- First, tell me...

00:52:08.644 --> 00:52:14.678 align:middle line:90%
have you been sending money to Ma?
- Of course! On the 1st of every month!

00:52:14.678 --> 00:52:21.828 align:middle line:90%
Say, you'd need some money,
wouldn't you? Keep this.

00:52:21.828 --> 00:52:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Looking for this thing?

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:26.556 align:middle line:90%
I guessed it was for me.
So why not take it for myself?

00:52:26.556 --> 00:52:29.358 align:middle line:84%
Want a ten or a twenty? No?

00:52:29.358 --> 00:52:41.657 align:middle line:90%
Bravo, my boy! You'll make
your guru proud someday.

00:52:41.657 --> 00:52:49.792 align:middle line:90%
And someday, I'll ask your father what
the gentleman's son grows up to be.

00:52:49.792 --> 00:52:54.147 align:middle line:84%
Mother!

00:52:54.147 --> 00:53:00.375 align:middle line:90%
Hello, mummy darling! Hello!
- Raj! Raj!

00:53:00.375 --> 00:53:07.738 align:middle line:90%
Raj, I've been dying to see you!
This time, it has been a whole year!

00:53:07.738 --> 00:53:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Where has this boss of yours
been taking you to?

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.327 align:middle line:90%
This time, I've been
to London and more.

00:53:13.327 --> 00:53:16.827 align:middle line:84%
London?

00:53:16.827 --> 00:53:20.653 align:middle line:90%
London, France, Paris,
New York, America.

00:53:20.653 --> 00:53:23.504 align:middle line:90%
On my way back, I even stopped
at Arthur Road.

00:53:23.504 --> 00:53:29.363 align:middle line:90%
My boss is into import and export.
- What's that?

00:53:29.363 --> 00:53:34.106 align:middle line:90%
You don't know import-export?
You're so naive.

00:53:34.106 --> 00:53:37.289 align:middle line:90%
Your son is about to become a big
businessman, and you don't know...

00:53:37.289 --> 00:53:42.409 align:middle line:90%
what import-export is?
Listen to this, Ma.

00:53:42.409 --> 00:53:49.166 align:middle line:90%
Import-export means moving the money
between here and there.

00:53:49.166 --> 00:53:53.925 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, it comes in this way.

00:53:53.925 --> 00:53:57.805 align:middle line:90%
How would I know?
You've even started talking English.

00:53:57.805 --> 00:54:28.136 align:middle line:84%
Sit, I'll get tea for you.

00:54:28.136 --> 00:54:31.311 align:middle line:84%
What are you looking at?

00:54:31.311 --> 00:54:33.859 align:middle line:84%
I'm a thief.

00:54:33.859 --> 00:54:37.498 align:middle line:84%
A lying thief.

00:54:37.498 --> 00:54:45.472 align:middle line:84%
I've sinned.

00:54:45.472 --> 00:54:50.672 align:middle line:84%
Why did you turn that photo over?

00:54:50.672 --> 00:54:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I look at it...

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.667 align:middle line:84%
she seems to be staring at me.

00:54:59.667 --> 00:55:03.882 align:middle line:90%
She brings back childhood memories.
Why don't you admit that?

00:55:03.882 --> 00:55:11.914 align:middle line:90%
Where could she be now?
Why don't you try to locate her?

00:55:11.914 --> 00:55:17.175 align:middle line:90%
Childhood days, and childhood friends
...do they ever come back, Ma?

00:55:17.175 --> 00:55:19.247 align:middle line:90%
I'm going out.
- But your tea?

00:55:19.247 --> 00:55:22.338 align:middle line:84%
Forget it. I've got to see a friend.

00:55:22.338 --> 00:56:00.812 align:middle line:84%
My son he is! Silly boy!

00:56:00.812 --> 00:56:04.170 align:middle line:90%
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:08.104 align:middle line:90%
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

00:56:08.104 --> 00:56:11.937 align:middle line:90%
"Meeting covertly at night is
considered as sin by others."

00:56:11.937 --> 00:56:12.848 align:middle line:84%
"Sin."

00:56:12.848 --> 00:56:16.620 align:middle line:90%
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:42.562 align:middle line:90%
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

00:56:42.562 --> 00:56:50.111 align:middle line:84%
"This is salacious youth."

00:56:50.111 --> 00:56:53.867 align:middle line:84%
"This is salacious youth."

00:56:53.867 --> 00:57:08.832 align:middle line:84%
"It is crazy for you."

00:57:08.832 --> 00:57:12.101 align:middle line:90%
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

00:57:12.101 --> 00:57:36.485 align:middle line:90%
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

00:57:36.485 --> 00:57:43.943 align:middle line:84%
"Why do you reject me?"

00:57:43.943 --> 00:57:47.673 align:middle line:84%
"Why do you reject me?"

00:57:47.673 --> 00:57:51.456 align:middle line:84%
"Why don't you look in my eyes?"

00:57:51.456 --> 00:57:55.232 align:middle line:84%
"Rob, the world is yours."

00:57:55.232 --> 00:57:58.944 align:middle line:84%
"Rob, the world is yours."

00:57:58.944 --> 00:58:02.683 align:middle line:84%
"Why are you afraid of love?"

00:58:02.683 --> 00:58:05.921 align:middle line:90%
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

00:58:05.921 --> 00:58:31.150 align:middle line:90%
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:36.483 align:middle line:90%
How much did you make today?
- Ten thousand five hundred.

00:58:36.483 --> 00:58:42.954 align:middle line:84%
Fifty-Fifty.

00:58:42.954 --> 00:58:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Why only fifty-fifty?
You can have many times more.

00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:49.355 align:middle line:90%
How?
- Tomorrow morning...

00:58:49.355 --> 00:58:53.271 align:middle line:90%
a bank is being inaugurated.
Say, how's the opportunity?

00:58:53.271 --> 00:58:56.660 align:middle line:90%
A sleight of hand, and there's
a hundred thousand or so going.

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.441 align:middle line:90%
All you need is a car.
- Car?

00:58:58.441 --> 00:59:02.612 align:middle line:90%
A good car.
- For me, that's a sleight of hand.

00:59:02.612 --> 00:59:06.192 align:middle line:90%
Eleven tomorrow. - Where?
- I'll tell you where.

00:59:06.192 --> 00:59:08.101 align:middle line:84%
Okay, boss.

00:59:08.101 --> 00:59:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Good! Someday,
you'll surely make me proud.

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:27.384 align:middle line:84%
It's late.

00:59:27.384 --> 00:59:30.349 align:middle line:84%
You have to make it by eleven.

00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:32.928 align:middle line:84%
First class car!

00:59:32.928 --> 00:59:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Car? Where?
- Out there

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.652 align:middle line:90%
Who's driving it?
- No idea.

00:59:38.652 --> 00:59:41.226 align:middle line:90%
A girl just got down
and walked into that shop.

00:59:41.226 --> 00:59:46.587 align:middle line:90%
Keys?
- With her, maybe.

00:59:46.587 --> 01:00:03.211 align:middle line:90%
That one?
- Yes.

01:00:03.211 --> 01:00:10.891 align:middle line:84%
Idiot! Can't you see?

01:00:10.891 --> 01:00:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Found it?

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.179 align:middle line:90%
No keys here.
- Then?

01:00:19.179 --> 01:00:21.229 align:middle line:90%
Return the bag.
- What for?

01:00:21.229 --> 01:00:24.634 align:middle line:90%
It will make things easier.
We'll make it work.

01:00:24.634 --> 01:00:30.344 align:middle line:84%
How will you return it?

01:00:30.344 --> 01:00:32.491 align:middle line:90%
What happened?
- I've been robbed!

01:00:32.491 --> 01:00:34.147 align:middle line:90%
Who did it?
- I didn't notice.

01:00:34.147 --> 01:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
He was with you!

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.564 align:middle line:90%
I had it a moment ago
- You didn't notice who robbed you?

01:00:40.564 --> 01:00:43.997 align:middle line:84%
Had I noticed, I would've caught him!

01:00:43.997 --> 01:00:45.458 align:middle line:84%
You...

01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:47.978 align:middle line:90%
Yes you!
- Who me?

01:00:47.978 --> 01:01:02.384 align:middle line:90%
Look, there goes the thief!
Stop! Thief!

01:01:02.384 --> 01:01:04.399 align:middle line:84%
He jumped over the wall!

01:01:04.399 --> 01:01:08.858 align:middle line:84%
Wait here

01:01:08.858 --> 01:01:17.524 align:middle line:84%
Come on, help me.

01:01:17.524 --> 01:01:27.350 align:middle line:84%
There you are! Hiding!

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:30.507 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you ashamed? Give it to me.
Else, I'll beat you to pulp.

01:01:30.507 --> 01:01:33.262 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to kill you! Give me!

01:01:33.262 --> 01:01:40.941 align:middle line:84%
Where are you running away?

01:01:40.941 --> 01:01:46.794 align:middle line:84%
Give the purse!

01:01:46.794 --> 01:01:51.227 align:middle line:84%
You dare stare at me like that?

01:01:51.227 --> 01:02:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Hey... knife!

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Are you running away? Coward!

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:11.696 align:middle line:84%
Coward!

01:02:11.696 --> 01:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Scoundrel!

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.750 align:middle line:84%
He ran away

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:24.531 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, here's your purse"

01:02:24.531 --> 01:02:26.546 align:middle line:84%
Keep it.

01:02:26.546 --> 01:02:32.357 align:middle line:90%
You've been through so much
trouble for my sake.

01:02:32.357 --> 01:02:37.323 align:middle line:84%
No trouble. I've taken more.

01:02:37.323 --> 01:02:43.654 align:middle line:90%
I should apologise. You risked
your life to get my purse back.

01:02:43.654 --> 01:02:48.785 align:middle line:90%
And I suspected you.
- Not your fault.

01:02:48.785 --> 01:02:50.645 align:middle line:84%
It's just my looks.

01:02:50.645 --> 01:02:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes even the police
are mistaken.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:57.414 align:middle line:84%
Bye

01:02:57.414 --> 01:03:00.897 align:middle line:90%
How was the show?
- No use.

01:03:00.897 --> 01:03:04.310 align:middle line:90%
We'll find a car. Why worry?
Get over to the place.

01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:08.167 align:middle line:90%
I'll join you after a change
of clothes.

01:03:08.167 --> 01:03:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Hey Romeo! You tear your clothes
no sooner than you see a girl!

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:34.915 align:middle line:90%
Get lost.
- Get going.

01:03:34.915 --> 01:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Stop! Thief!

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.453 align:middle line:84%
Where are you going?

01:04:34.453 --> 01:04:36.778 align:middle line:84%
Inside.

01:04:36.778 --> 01:04:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Inside? What do you want?
- Strange question.

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.911 align:middle line:90%
Your boss is the one who called me.
And you ask me what I want?

01:04:43.911 --> 01:04:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The boss, or the lady? Who called you?

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.245 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the lady.

01:04:48.245 --> 01:04:51.620 align:middle line:90%
So you're the one
who fixes the piano?

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:55.661 align:middle line:84%
Yes! The piano fixer!

01:04:55.661 --> 01:04:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Is the piano in there?
- Are pianos kept outside?

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:23.837 align:middle line:90%
No! Inside. Come on in,
else I'll get into trouble.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:34.421 align:middle line:84%
Looks like a billionaire's palace!

01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:44.599 align:middle line:90%
Hello, darling.
- What did you say?

01:05:44.599 --> 01:05:47.772 align:middle line:84%
The mantle!

01:05:47.772 --> 01:05:51.524 align:middle line:84%
What a lovely mantle!

01:05:51.524 --> 01:05:57.802 align:middle line:84%
What a grand mansion!

01:05:57.802 --> 01:06:00.550 align:middle line:84%
The mantle!

01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:06.592 align:middle line:90%
What kind of a joke is this?
Here's the piano.

01:06:06.592 --> 01:06:09.666 align:middle line:90%
This piano is in bad shape.
Badly damaged.

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:11.974 align:middle line:84%
Look.

01:06:11.974 --> 01:06:17.415 align:middle line:90%
Rotten! It'll take me time to fix it.
Go on, get back to work.

01:06:17.415 --> 01:06:41.696 align:middle line:84%
I'll fix it.

01:06:41.696 --> 01:06:47.415 align:middle line:84%
Who's playing my piano?

01:06:47.415 --> 01:06:58.999 align:middle line:90%
You?
- You!

01:06:58.999 --> 01:07:04.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm mistaken, once again
I thought it must be a thief.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.189 align:middle line:90%
That's what I am.
- What?

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:09.832 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who else but a thief
would come in uninvited?

01:07:09.832 --> 01:07:12.981 align:middle line:84%
No, it's good of you to have come.

01:07:12.981 --> 01:07:17.361 align:middle line:90%
You did me a favour.
I should've called you over.

01:07:17.361 --> 01:07:22.473 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know your address.
How did you find out my address?

01:07:22.473 --> 01:07:27.505 align:middle line:90%
What?
- How did you find out my address?

01:07:27.505 --> 01:07:30.691 align:middle line:90%
No, don't ask me that.
It's a secret.

01:07:30.691 --> 01:07:33.585 align:middle line:90%
Let's say, it's luck that has led me
to your doorstep.

01:07:33.585 --> 01:07:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Please be seated
- Thanks.

01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:52.729 align:middle line:84%
Cigarette?

01:07:52.729 --> 01:07:54.925 align:middle line:84%
Lighter?

01:07:54.925 --> 01:07:58.104 align:middle line:84%
No, thanks. Matches.

01:07:58.104 --> 01:08:01.333 align:middle line:90%
Madam, he's the piano-fixer...
- Piano fixer?

01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:03.837 align:middle line:90%
Your servant thinks I'm here
to fix the piano.

01:08:03.837 --> 01:08:10.768 align:middle line:90%
But you said...
- Never mind, take the call. Go on.

01:08:10.768 --> 01:08:15.594 align:middle line:90%
Strange fellow.
He took you for a piano mechanic.

01:08:15.594 --> 01:08:19.622 align:middle line:90%
Not his fault.
It's just my looks.

01:08:19.622 --> 01:08:22.362 align:middle line:84%
Inspector sahib, no thief came in here.

01:08:22.362 --> 01:08:24.127 align:middle line:84%
Please wait here.

01:08:24.127 --> 01:08:26.397 align:middle line:84%
Inspector?

01:08:26.397 --> 01:08:31.809 align:middle line:90%
What brings the police here?
Excuse me, I'll be back.

01:08:31.809 --> 01:08:38.151 align:middle line:90%
A car thief has sneaked into one
of the houses in this neighbourhood.

01:08:38.151 --> 01:08:43.781 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen anyone?
- No, no one came in here.

01:08:43.781 --> 01:08:48.585 align:middle line:90%
She's wrong about
no one coming in here.

01:08:48.585 --> 01:08:51.743 align:middle line:90%
I happen to be a visitor.
Would you be looking for me?

01:08:51.743 --> 01:08:54.252 align:middle line:84%
No... how could this be?

01:08:54.252 --> 01:08:58.676 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Forgive me.

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:02.381 align:middle line:84%
Come.

01:09:02.381 --> 01:09:05.857 align:middle line:90%
Grand house.
- Yes. It belongs to the Judge.

01:09:05.857 --> 01:09:09.112 align:middle line:90%
Judge?
- Yes, he's my guardian.

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:10.836 align:middle line:84%
Guardian?

01:09:10.836 --> 01:09:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Like the guard on the train
...signalling red and green?

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.202 align:middle line:90%
No. After my father passed away,
I have been his ward.

01:09:18.202 --> 01:09:21.404 align:middle line:90%
For the sake of my education,
he left Lucknow and he came to Bombay.

01:09:21.404 --> 01:09:24.889 align:middle line:84%
I am much obliged to him.

01:09:24.889 --> 01:09:29.532 align:middle line:90%
Do judges sport such grand houses?
He must be making a pile on the side.

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:32.761 align:middle line:90%
What a thing to say!
The judge is very principled.

01:09:32.761 --> 01:09:38.760 align:middle line:90%
He never spares criminals.
- I hope God spares him!

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:45.437 align:middle line:90%
Not to worry. If you're ever arraigned
in his court, let me defend your case.

01:09:45.437 --> 01:09:51.553 align:middle line:90%
You... lawyer?
- Yes.

01:09:51.553 --> 01:09:55.353 align:middle line:84%
I took you for a schoolgirl.

01:09:55.353 --> 01:09:58.953 align:middle line:90%
That was a nice one. A couple
of months, and I'll be an advocate.

01:09:58.953 --> 01:10:02.454 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to see my degree?

01:10:02.454 --> 01:10:08.347 align:middle line:90%
A judge lives here. And a lawyer too.
Leaves only one to make a full court!

01:10:08.347 --> 01:10:11.452 align:middle line:90%
Yours truly. And here I am.
- And what are you up to?

01:10:11.452 --> 01:10:12.984 align:middle line:84%
I steal.

01:10:12.984 --> 01:10:16.362 align:middle line:90%
Stealing, picking pockets, locks,
ladies' purses, like yours...

01:10:16.362 --> 01:10:19.520 align:middle line:90%
that's what I'm up to.
- You're joking again. Be seated.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.184 align:middle line:90%
You don't think I'm a thief?
- No, I think you're a gentleman.

01:10:24.184 --> 01:10:27.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the new world order!

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.414 align:middle line:90%
The thieves, the hoodwinkers, they
all dress in first class suits like...

01:10:31.414 --> 01:10:34.766 align:middle line:90%
...I'm wearing and
we take them for gentlemen.

01:10:34.766 --> 01:10:39.684 align:middle line:90%
But those who work hard for an
honest living and dress shabbily...

01:10:39.684 --> 01:10:45.351 align:middle line:90%
...are labelled tramps and wastrels.
The capitalists, the blackmarketeers...

01:10:45.351 --> 01:10:50.851 align:middle line:90%
the profiteers, the usurers...
who are they? Thieves, like I am!

01:10:50.851 --> 01:10:55.890 align:middle line:90%
You sound like a stock broker
or a banker.

01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:57.596 align:middle line:90%
You might say that give and take
of money is what I'm concerned with.

01:10:57.596 --> 01:11:00.992 align:middle line:90%
As far as banks are concerned,
I visit banks regularly.

01:11:00.992 --> 01:11:04.476 align:middle line:84%
Be seated.

01:11:04.476 --> 01:11:21.756 align:middle line:84%
Tell me your name.

01:11:21.756 --> 01:11:32.165 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, whose photo is this?
- Mine.

01:11:32.165 --> 01:11:36.422 align:middle line:90%
You?
- Yes, when I was young.

01:11:36.422 --> 01:11:39.526 align:middle line:84%
It's a birthday photo.

01:11:39.526 --> 01:11:50.329 align:middle line:90%
Your name?
- Rita. Why?

01:11:50.329 --> 01:11:55.476 align:middle line:90%
Ms Rita, would you like to come
to my house?

01:11:55.476 --> 01:11:59.531 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to show you
something unique.

01:11:59.531 --> 01:12:14.162 align:middle line:90%
My mother would be very pleased
to meet you. Come

01:12:14.162 --> 01:12:16.784 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

01:12:16.784 --> 01:12:18.526 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:12:18.526 --> 01:12:29.512 align:middle line:90%
You?
- After twelve years.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:32.767 align:middle line:84%
You've changed!

01:12:32.767 --> 01:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
You haven't changed at all.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:42.489 align:middle line:84%
Where have you been, Raj?

01:12:42.489 --> 01:12:45.781 align:middle line:84%
Looking for you.

01:12:45.781 --> 01:12:49.369 align:middle line:90%
And at last, I've found you
- And when I saw you...

01:12:49.369 --> 01:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I took you for a thief.

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:57.867 align:middle line:90%
Not your fault.
It's in my looks.

01:12:57.867 --> 01:13:44.797 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

01:13:44.797 --> 01:13:51.418 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:13:51.418 --> 01:14:08.589 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:14:08.589 --> 01:14:12.918 align:middle line:84%
"The heart had spoken to a heart."

01:14:12.918 --> 01:14:17.176 align:middle line:84%
"The heart had spoken to a heart."

01:14:17.176 --> 01:14:21.750 align:middle line:84%
"The old times have come back."

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:25.792 align:middle line:84%
"The old times have come back."

01:14:25.792 --> 01:14:31.836 align:middle line:90%
"He brought the happiness with
him, my heart flutters."

01:14:31.836 --> 01:14:48.801 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:14:48.801 --> 01:14:53.136 align:middle line:90%
"From the eyes, he dwelled
in my heart."

01:14:53.136 --> 01:14:57.355 align:middle line:90%
"From the eyes, he dwelled
in my heart."

01:14:57.355 --> 01:15:01.256 align:middle line:84%
"I smile and scatter the stars."

01:15:01.256 --> 01:15:05.819 align:middle line:84%
"I smile and scatter the stars."

01:15:05.819 --> 01:15:12.600 align:middle line:90%
"Feelings dance and sing,
my heart flutters."

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:29.500 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:33.298 align:middle line:90%
"The days belong to us
and love is young."

01:15:33.298 --> 01:15:37.689 align:middle line:90%
"The days belong to us
and love is young."

01:15:37.689 --> 01:15:41.544 align:middle line:90%
"My world is flourishing
due to him."

01:15:41.544 --> 01:15:46.600 align:middle line:90%
"My world is flourishing
due to him."

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:52.291 align:middle line:90%
"The thief returned to my heart,
my heart flutters."

01:15:52.291 --> 01:15:58.783 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:15:58.783 --> 01:16:06.138 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:16:06.138 --> 01:16:10.552 align:middle line:84%
The Judge is here.

01:16:10.552 --> 01:16:13.177 align:middle line:84%
So here you are. And you're late.

01:16:13.177 --> 01:16:18.940 align:middle line:90%
The doctor has told you to come home
and rest for at least an hour.

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:21.827 align:middle line:90%
But you won't listen.
You look so tired.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Rita.
- Hello, Rita!

01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:28.754 align:middle line:90%
Just sit here. I'll get you
your dressing gown.

01:16:28.754 --> 01:16:31.427 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, where have you been
all this time?

01:16:31.427 --> 01:16:36.599 align:middle line:90%
I had a lecture in the law college.
I went there directly from the court.

01:16:36.599 --> 01:16:40.795 align:middle line:90%
All that jabbering
is giving me a headache.

01:16:40.795 --> 01:16:46.277 align:middle line:90%
That's bound to happen. The doctor
told you to eat before eight.

01:16:46.277 --> 01:16:50.587 align:middle line:84%
It's nine thirty now.

01:16:50.587 --> 01:16:56.829 align:middle line:90%
Listen to that!
Even the clock is angry with you.

01:16:56.829 --> 01:17:17.564 align:middle line:84%
Come on.

01:17:17.564 --> 01:17:22.599 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about yourself. What have
you been up to all evening?

01:17:22.599 --> 01:17:29.362 align:middle line:90%
You look as if you've found
a treasure.

01:17:29.362 --> 01:17:33.545 align:middle line:90%
You could say that. A long-lost friend
is no less than a treasure.

01:17:33.545 --> 01:17:44.337 align:middle line:90%
You'll be glad when you meet Raj.
You're certain to like him!

01:17:44.337 --> 01:17:52.171 align:middle line:90%
Who is this Mr. Raj? Where does he live?
What does he do? What's his family name?

01:17:52.171 --> 01:17:57.139 align:middle line:90%
He's a childhood friend.
We were in school together.

01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:59.912 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing him after twelve years!

01:17:59.912 --> 01:18:03.762 align:middle line:84%
After twelve years?

01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:06.450 align:middle line:90%
After so many years,
most people change.

01:18:06.450 --> 01:18:10.293 align:middle line:90%
Raj has changed too. At school,
he used to be very quiet.

01:18:10.293 --> 01:18:13.635 align:middle line:90%
Now he has great sense of humour.
When I asked him what he's up to...

01:18:13.635 --> 01:18:16.795 align:middle line:84%
he said he's a thief.

01:18:16.795 --> 01:18:21.754 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that wasn't a joke?
- I don't follow you.

01:18:21.754 --> 01:18:24.545 align:middle line:84%
Never mind.

01:18:24.545 --> 01:18:27.676 align:middle line:90%
You know what young men
are like, these days.

01:18:27.676 --> 01:20:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Who knows, they might steal
something valuable.

01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:10.501 align:middle line:90%
The water is deep.
You might drown.

01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:17.566 align:middle line:90%
Not without you
- Is that so? Try that.

01:20:17.566 --> 01:20:37.766 align:middle line:84%
Is that so?

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:40.124 align:middle line:90%
Hey lady, haven't you finished
dressing yet?

01:20:40.124 --> 01:20:44.387 align:middle line:90%
Where are you headed?
Gentlemen don't barge in...

01:20:44.387 --> 01:20:48.751 align:middle line:90%
when ladies are changing dresses.
Don't you know that?

01:20:48.751 --> 01:20:58.793 align:middle line:84%
How would I know?

01:20:58.793 --> 01:21:07.221 align:middle line:90%
I'm no gentleman.
- Savage.

01:21:07.221 --> 01:21:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Savage.

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:17.418 align:middle line:90%
I'm not about to give in
to your type.

01:21:17.418 --> 01:21:20.843 align:middle line:84%
Where are you running away?

01:21:20.843 --> 01:21:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Let go of my hand. What kind
of a stupid joke is this?

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.399 align:middle line:84%
You savage!

01:21:26.399 --> 01:21:29.157 align:middle line:90%
Am I?
- Yes! You're a savage!

01:21:29.157 --> 01:21:32.562 align:middle line:90%
Savage?
I'm a penniless, uneducated tramp!

01:21:32.562 --> 01:21:34.864 align:middle line:84%
I don't fit into high society!

01:21:34.864 --> 01:21:37.459 align:middle line:90%
How dare I maul your fragile body
with my beastly hands.

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:39.751 align:middle line:90%
I told Ma that childhood friends,
like childhood days are gone...

01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:43.125 align:middle line:84%
never to return.

01:21:43.125 --> 01:21:47.787 align:middle line:84%
Good of you to have told me my class.

01:21:47.787 --> 01:21:51.228 align:middle line:84%
It was a joke. Don't get angry.

01:21:51.228 --> 01:22:02.530 align:middle line:84%
You want to hit me? Go ahead.

01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Whom will I hit?

01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:08.648 align:middle line:84%
You?

01:22:08.648 --> 01:22:40.875 align:middle line:84%
Or myself?

01:22:40.875 --> 01:22:45.819 align:middle line:84%
Hey! Hey!

01:22:45.819 --> 01:22:48.836 align:middle line:84%
Are you happy?

01:22:48.836 --> 01:22:51.907 align:middle line:84%
No.

01:22:51.907 --> 01:22:56.685 align:middle line:90%
Where are you lost?
- Up there

01:22:56.685 --> 01:23:00.898 align:middle line:90%
Come back.
- Where to?

01:23:00.898 --> 01:23:05.378 align:middle line:90%
Beside me.
- Why?

01:23:05.378 --> 01:23:16.232 align:middle line:84%
No reason.

01:23:16.232 --> 01:23:22.172 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you ashamed?

01:23:22.172 --> 01:23:27.883 align:middle line:90%
What are you looking at?
The Moon?

01:23:27.883 --> 01:23:32.308 align:middle line:84%
No. Clouds.

01:23:32.308 --> 01:23:35.118 align:middle line:90%
What's your problem?
You don't see the Moon...

01:23:35.118 --> 01:23:40.868 align:middle line:90%
and you see the dark clouds?
Won't you tell me?

01:23:40.868 --> 01:23:44.695 align:middle line:84%
Who else can I tell?

01:23:44.695 --> 01:23:47.618 align:middle line:90%
Rita.
- Yes.

01:23:47.618 --> 01:23:50.450 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing each other
after twelve years.

01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:52.385 align:middle line:84%
So what?

01:23:52.385 --> 01:23:57.268 align:middle line:90%
A lot changes in twelve years.
- The Judge said that too!

01:23:57.268 --> 01:24:02.790 align:middle line:90%
But I don't agree. Look at us.
We're still friends.

01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:09.285 align:middle line:90%
The Judge is right.
You know nothing about me.

01:24:09.285 --> 01:24:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Who I am...

01:24:11.670 --> 01:24:14.484 align:middle line:84%
My circumstances...

01:24:14.484 --> 01:24:17.573 align:middle line:84%
My family background...

01:24:17.573 --> 01:24:22.326 align:middle line:90%
What I have been doing...
what I am doing.

01:24:22.326 --> 01:24:29.980 align:middle line:90%
You know nothing about me.
- Nor do I want to know.

01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:35.437 align:middle line:90%
All I know is that you are
the one I...

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:42.338 align:middle line:90%
Rita, you are so nice.
But so naive.

01:24:42.338 --> 01:24:45.770 align:middle line:90%
And you're such a fool.
A savage.

01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking to you.

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Look.

01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:55.113 align:middle line:84%
The clouds?

01:24:55.113 --> 01:24:59.371 align:middle line:84%
They are moving away from my Moon.

01:24:59.371 --> 01:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, today's my birthday.

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Which? Tenth? Eleventh?

01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:09.577 align:middle line:84%
You don't ask a lady that.

01:25:09.577 --> 01:25:12.410 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'll whisper it to you.

01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Twenty one.

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.918 align:middle line:84%
No! It's looking at us.

01:25:17.918 --> 01:25:23.638 align:middle line:90%
What?
- That!

01:25:23.638 --> 01:25:36.712 align:middle line:84%
"Turn your face away for a moment."

01:25:36.712 --> 01:25:47.982 align:middle line:90%
"Turn your face away for a moment,
O moon."

01:25:47.982 --> 01:25:52.170 align:middle line:84%
"I will love him."

01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:56.520 align:middle line:90%
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:03.719 align:middle line:90%
"Turn your face away for a moment,
O moon."

01:26:03.719 --> 01:26:07.635 align:middle line:84%
"I will love him."

01:26:07.635 --> 01:26:24.437 align:middle line:90%
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

01:26:24.437 --> 01:26:32.300 align:middle line:84%
"The heart worships love."

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.892 align:middle line:84%
"The heart worships love."

01:26:35.892 --> 01:26:40.244 align:middle line:84%
"And even I am with him."

01:26:40.244 --> 01:26:44.135 align:middle line:90%
"The stars look at
the moon everyday..

01:26:44.135 --> 01:26:47.827 align:middle line:84%
..but this is my first night."

01:26:47.827 --> 01:26:51.940 align:middle line:84%
"My first night."

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:58.677 align:middle line:84%
"Go and hide in the clouds, O moon."

01:26:58.677 --> 01:27:02.427 align:middle line:84%
"I will love him."

01:27:02.427 --> 01:27:06.135 align:middle line:90%
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

01:27:06.135 --> 01:27:13.747 align:middle line:84%
"Turn your face here for a moment."

01:27:13.747 --> 01:27:21.321 align:middle line:90%
"Turn your face here for a moment,
O moon."

01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:24.969 align:middle line:84%
"I will love her."

01:27:24.969 --> 01:27:41.885 align:middle line:84%
"I will lock eyes with her."

01:27:41.885 --> 01:27:49.466 align:middle line:84%
"I am a thief, my work is to steal."

01:27:49.466 --> 01:27:53.344 align:middle line:84%
"I am a thief, my work is to steal."

01:27:53.344 --> 01:27:57.552 align:middle line:84%
"I have a bad name in the world."

01:27:57.552 --> 01:28:05.177 align:middle line:90%
"I have been stealing hearts,
this is my work."

01:28:05.177 --> 01:28:08.469 align:middle line:84%
"This is my work."

01:28:08.469 --> 01:28:15.885 align:middle line:84%
"You come as a witness, O moon."

01:28:15.885 --> 01:28:19.594 align:middle line:84%
"I will love her."

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:36.903 align:middle line:84%
"I will lock eyes with her."

01:28:36.903 --> 01:28:44.486 align:middle line:90%
"Don't get lost after
stealing my heart."

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:48.374 align:middle line:90%
"Don't get lost after
stealing my heart."

01:28:48.374 --> 01:28:52.176 align:middle line:84%
"Don't forget the path."

01:28:52.176 --> 01:28:59.627 align:middle line:90%
"Under these feet don't crush,
the flower of my heart."

01:28:59.627 --> 01:29:02.876 align:middle line:84%
"The flower of my heart."

01:29:02.876 --> 01:29:10.302 align:middle line:84%
"Explain this to him, O moon."

01:29:10.302 --> 01:29:14.136 align:middle line:84%
"I will love him."

01:29:14.136 --> 01:29:17.822 align:middle line:90%
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

01:29:17.822 --> 01:29:25.315 align:middle line:90%
"Turn your face here for a moment,
O moon."

01:29:25.315 --> 01:29:28.966 align:middle line:84%
"I will love her."

01:29:28.966 --> 01:29:33.575 align:middle line:84%
"I will lock eyes with her."

01:29:33.575 --> 01:29:51.815 align:middle line:84%
"Turn your face away for a moment."

01:29:51.815 --> 01:29:55.565 align:middle line:90%
One step more, and the boat
will turn over and sink.

01:29:55.565 --> 01:30:00.568 align:middle line:84%
So what?

01:30:00.568 --> 01:30:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Let the boat sink.

01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:16.351 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:30:16.351 --> 01:30:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Yes.

01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:32.989 align:middle line:84%
Judge sir!

01:30:32.989 --> 01:30:36.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't want it
- But the doctor says...

01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:54.319 align:middle line:84%
I should eat by eight.

01:30:54.319 --> 01:31:06.557 align:middle line:90%
Tonight, it's my turn
to be admonished by the clock.

01:31:06.557 --> 01:31:17.291 align:middle line:84%
You are angry with me, aren't you?

01:31:17.291 --> 01:31:19.869 align:middle line:84%
Today I was...

01:31:19.869 --> 01:31:22.245 align:middle line:90%
With Raj?
- Raj is no stranger.

01:31:22.245 --> 01:31:28.914 align:middle line:84%
He's a childhood friend.

01:31:28.914 --> 01:31:31.421 align:middle line:84%
I..

01:31:31.421 --> 01:31:33.873 align:middle line:84%
I..

01:31:33.873 --> 01:31:38.915 align:middle line:90%
I made a promise
to your dying father.

01:31:38.915 --> 01:31:42.329 align:middle line:90%
To take care of you
as long as I live.

01:31:42.329 --> 01:31:44.810 align:middle line:84%
You must make a promise.

01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:51.583 align:middle line:90%
If someone likes you,
if you like someone...

01:31:51.583 --> 01:31:54.294 align:middle line:90%
...you will not give your consent
without telling me.

01:31:54.294 --> 01:31:59.206 align:middle line:84%
I know, I am much obliged to you.

01:31:59.206 --> 01:32:35.790 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't mean that
you can, time and again...

01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:38.623 align:middle line:84%
Boss?

01:32:38.623 --> 01:32:42.733 align:middle line:90%
Recognise me?
Thank you very much!

01:32:42.733 --> 01:32:46.623 align:middle line:84%
You haven't much time nowadays.

01:32:46.623 --> 01:32:50.748 align:middle line:84%
Well son, are you falling in love?

01:32:50.748 --> 01:32:56.692 align:middle line:90%
Or, have you given up your profession
for fear of going to jail?

01:32:56.692 --> 01:32:59.800 align:middle line:90%
You don't know the size of the scam
I've planned for you.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:05.775 align:middle line:90%
She's an heiress.
Just wait for a few days.

01:33:05.775 --> 01:33:09.577 align:middle line:90%
I'm angling for a diamond necklace.
- Bravo!

01:33:09.577 --> 01:33:15.734 align:middle line:90%
I knew it! You aren't the type
to waste your time.

01:33:15.734 --> 01:33:19.420 align:middle line:84%
But remember!

01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:44.791 align:middle line:84%
If you try to cheat Jagga...

01:33:44.791 --> 01:33:53.799 align:middle line:90%
'Nor do I want to know. All I know
is that you are the one I...'

01:33:53.799 --> 01:33:55.359 align:middle line:84%
'Really?'

01:33:55.359 --> 01:36:33.698 align:middle line:90%
'Remember! If you try
to cheat Jagga...'

01:36:33.698 --> 01:36:39.614 align:middle line:90%
"Without you this moonlight
is like fire."

01:36:39.614 --> 01:36:42.698 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:36:42.698 --> 01:36:46.169 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:36:46.169 --> 01:36:51.950 align:middle line:90%
"Without you this moonlight
is like fire."

01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:55.310 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:58.599 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:36:58.599 --> 01:37:03.948 align:middle line:90%
"The flute is not melodious
without you."

01:37:03.948 --> 01:37:10.537 align:middle line:90%
"This life of mine is
a melody of pain."

01:37:10.537 --> 01:37:13.651 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

"Do come."

01:37:28.765 --> 01:37:31.861 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:37:31.861 --> 01:37:35.650 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:37:35.650 --> 01:37:38.114 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:37:38.114 --> 01:38:13.263 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:38:13.263 --> 01:38:16.562 align:middle line:90%
"This is not life,
this is not life."

01:38:16.562 --> 01:38:33.770 align:middle line:84%
"This is not life."

01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:38.740 align:middle line:90%
"I am burning alive in
this fire of life."

01:38:38.740 --> 01:39:01.158 align:middle line:84%
"The arrows of fire run through me."

01:39:01.158 --> 01:39:04.625 align:middle line:84%
"I don't want this hell."

01:39:04.625 --> 01:39:09.190 align:middle line:90%
"I want the flower, the
love, the friend."

01:39:09.190 --> 01:39:12.694 align:middle line:84%
"I want the spring."

01:39:12.694 --> 01:39:15.930 align:middle line:84%
"I want the spring."

01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:19.319 align:middle line:84%
"I want the spring."

01:39:19.319 --> 01:39:37.328 align:middle line:84%
"I want the spring."

01:39:37.328 --> 01:39:50.646 align:middle line:84%
"Om Namah Shivay."

01:39:50.646 --> 01:40:03.763 align:middle line:84%
"Om Namah Shivay."

01:40:03.763 --> 01:40:37.724 align:middle line:84%
"Om.."

01:40:37.724 --> 01:40:42.807 align:middle line:84%
"My foreigner has returned home."

01:40:42.807 --> 01:40:57.724 align:middle line:84%
"The thirst in my eyes is quenched."

01:40:57.724 --> 01:41:07.628 align:middle line:84%
"You are the pearl of my heart."

01:41:07.628 --> 01:41:17.463 align:middle line:84%

Rita!

01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:41.872 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:43:41.872 --> 01:43:51.809 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:43:51.809 --> 01:43:57.309 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:43:57.309 --> 01:44:03.591 align:middle line:90%
Mother! Mother, save me. Mother!
- Raju!

01:44:03.591 --> 01:44:06.855 align:middle line:84%
Ma, I want to be good!

01:44:06.855 --> 01:44:09.987 align:middle line:90%
I promise, I won't have anything to do
with Jagga and those others!

01:44:09.987 --> 01:44:14.180 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather starve than steal.
I will be good.

01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:17.827 align:middle line:90%
People will say I'm honest!
Let's go back to our slum.

01:44:17.827 --> 01:44:23.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll work hard for a living.
I won't steal! Ma, I won't steal!

01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:26.755 align:middle line:90%
I want nothing but peace of mind,
and my mother's blessings.

01:44:26.755 --> 01:45:12.926 align:middle line:90%
I won't steal, Ma.
I'll become honest.

01:45:12.926 --> 01:45:16.673 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.

01:45:16.673 --> 01:45:22.256 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?
- You're fired. We won't need you.

01:45:22.256 --> 01:45:24.600 align:middle line:90%
What?
- Go away, get out!

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.957 align:middle line:84%
We don't employ thieves.

01:45:26.957 --> 01:45:30.739 align:middle line:84%
As you wish.

01:45:30.739 --> 01:45:37.214 align:middle line:90%
May I ask something, sir? You say
you don't want to employ thieves?

01:45:37.214 --> 01:45:40.961 align:middle line:90%
Would you rather that they keep
thieving all their lives?

01:45:40.961 --> 01:45:59.339 align:middle line:84%
Get out!

01:45:59.339 --> 01:46:02.673 align:middle line:84%
Raj! Raj!

01:46:02.673 --> 01:46:08.103 align:middle line:90%
Fired?
Come on, the boss is calling you.

01:46:08.103 --> 01:46:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Raj, what reply do I carry back
to the boss?

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:15.890 align:middle line:84%
This..

01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:17.339 align:middle line:90%
He will either steal
or he will starve.

01:46:17.339 --> 01:46:22.653 align:middle line:90%
And how long will he not steal?
He has no way out of crime.

01:46:22.653 --> 01:46:33.482 align:middle line:84%
Let me see how far he goes.

01:46:33.482 --> 01:46:37.468 align:middle line:84%
Where are you going?

01:46:37.468 --> 01:46:42.807 align:middle line:90%
To see Rita.
- You can't go in. The Judge's orders.

01:46:42.807 --> 01:46:47.144 align:middle line:84%
The Judge's orders?

01:46:47.144 --> 01:46:52.968 align:middle line:90%
Then go and tell her that
Raj is waiting out here to see her.

01:46:52.968 --> 01:47:01.967 align:middle line:90%
I have much to tell her.
- She can't see anyone. Get going.

01:47:01.967 --> 01:47:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Get going? Where to?

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:25.317 align:middle line:84%
Come friend.

01:47:25.317 --> 01:47:29.533 align:middle line:84%
Let me talk to you.

01:47:29.533 --> 01:47:39.234 align:middle line:90%
Strange coincidence, isn't it?
You're a tramp, I'm a tramp too.

01:47:39.234 --> 01:47:46.317 align:middle line:90%
You have no name,
I have no name either.

01:47:46.317 --> 01:47:53.901 align:middle line:90%
You are homeless,
I have no home either.

01:47:53.901 --> 01:47:57.942 align:middle line:84%
Like me, you too crave for love.

01:47:57.942 --> 01:48:04.105 align:middle line:90%
Difference being only that
you are an animal, and I'm human.

01:48:04.105 --> 01:48:11.944 align:middle line:84%
Human.

01:48:11.944 --> 01:48:15.542 align:middle line:84%
I have nothing to give you.

01:48:15.542 --> 01:48:27.458 align:middle line:84%
I can only give love.

01:48:27.458 --> 01:48:30.796 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you watch your step?
Are you blind?

01:48:30.796 --> 01:48:46.819 align:middle line:90%
Mind your tongue.
Bloody savage.

01:48:46.819 --> 01:48:50.542 align:middle line:84%
Savage... am I a savage?

01:48:50.542 --> 01:49:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Am I a mongrel on the streets?
To be kicked at will or whim?

01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:59.385 align:middle line:84%
Piano-fixer?

01:49:59.385 --> 01:50:12.705 align:middle line:90%
Your servant thinks
I'm here to fix the piano.

01:50:12.705 --> 01:50:17.410 align:middle line:90%
"Please come now,
my desires are squirming."

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:22.426 align:middle line:90%
"Please come now,
my desires are squirming."

01:50:22.426 --> 01:50:27.382 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:50:27.382 --> 01:50:32.365 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:50:32.365 --> 01:50:37.368 align:middle line:90%
"I lie crying here,
you are silent there."

01:50:37.368 --> 01:50:42.329 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:50:42.329 --> 01:50:55.364 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:50:55.364 --> 01:51:02.196 align:middle line:90%
"The brightness of the
moon is fading."

01:51:02.196 --> 01:51:14.955 align:middle line:90%
"Even the hearts of stars
are vanishing. Vanishing."

01:51:14.955 --> 01:51:19.660 align:middle line:84%
"The fervent ambiance is painful."

01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:24.656 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:51:24.656 --> 01:51:39.624 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:51:39.624 --> 01:51:47.580 align:middle line:84%
"In the palanquin of the moon."

01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:52.116 align:middle line:84%
"In the palanquin of the moon."

01:51:52.116 --> 01:52:02.750 align:middle line:90%
"Where is the bride of night going to?
Where is she going?"

01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:14.790 align:middle line:84%
"Even the fate is about to sleep."

01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:19.521 align:middle line:90%
"You do not arrive,
where will I go?"

01:52:19.521 --> 01:52:24.599 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:52:24.599 --> 01:52:29.569 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:52:29.569 --> 01:52:34.592 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:52:34.592 --> 01:52:39.437 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:52:39.437 --> 01:52:44.559 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:52:44.559 --> 01:53:26.135 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:53:26.135 --> 01:53:33.235 align:middle line:84%
Rita.

01:53:33.235 --> 01:53:35.523 align:middle line:84%
Rita.

01:53:35.523 --> 01:53:39.124 align:middle line:84%
Rita.

01:53:39.124 --> 01:53:44.757 align:middle line:84%
The invitations have been printed.

01:53:44.757 --> 01:53:47.965 align:middle line:90%
The day after tomorrow
is your birthday, isn't it?

01:53:47.965 --> 01:53:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Send them to the friends
you want to invite.

01:53:54.390 --> 01:54:03.779 align:middle line:84%
All my friends?

01:54:03.779 --> 01:54:19.899 align:middle line:90%
Yes, all friends. All, who are
worthy of being your friends.

01:54:19.899 --> 01:54:26.506 align:middle line:84%
Your birthday.

01:54:26.506 --> 01:54:30.333 align:middle line:84%
Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?

01:54:30.333 --> 01:54:34.588 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have money to buy anything.
I'll give you some other time.

01:54:34.588 --> 01:54:38.757 align:middle line:90%
Must you only buy something
to make a gift?

01:54:38.757 --> 01:54:41.253 align:middle line:84%
You can give me a flower.

01:54:41.253 --> 01:54:44.566 align:middle line:90%
Someday, I'm going to make
lots of money.

01:54:44.566 --> 01:55:03.299 align:middle line:90%
And I'll buy a gift for you.
Something better than all this.

01:55:03.299 --> 01:55:08.742 align:middle line:90%
Back? I knew someday,
you'd surely come back.

01:55:08.742 --> 01:55:12.366 align:middle line:84%
For you, this is the only door open.

01:55:12.366 --> 01:55:19.230 align:middle line:90%
I need a thousand. A loan
I'll return it after I've earned it.

01:55:19.230 --> 01:55:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Loan? What d'you think I am,
a money-lender?

01:55:23.690 --> 01:55:31.629 align:middle line:90%
Today is Rita's birthday.
Look, she has invited me.

01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:36.548 align:middle line:90%
She takes me for a gentleman.
- So you must dress like a gentleman.

01:55:36.548 --> 01:55:45.423 align:middle line:90%
And to prove yourself, you must
also make a gift to the lady.

01:55:45.423 --> 01:55:50.421 align:middle line:90%
So gentlemanliness is for sale,
and you intend buying some?

01:55:50.421 --> 01:55:56.470 align:middle line:90%
But to become a gentleman, you need
money. One thousand Rupees.

01:55:56.470 --> 01:56:03.675 align:middle line:90%
For that thousand, you have to steal,
rob, or maybe even kill someone for me.

01:56:03.675 --> 01:56:06.436 align:middle line:90%
Do you accept?
- No.

01:56:06.436 --> 01:56:11.426 align:middle line:90%
No! I won't rob!
I won't commit crimes!

01:56:11.426 --> 01:56:17.470 align:middle line:84%
What other way out have you?

01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:22.713 align:middle line:90%
Once a criminal, you can never
become a gentleman again!

01:56:22.713 --> 01:56:26.560 align:middle line:90%
No matter how many times
you change your clothes.

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:31.140 align:middle line:90%
Crime is written all over your face!
You even tried working.

01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:34.327 align:middle line:90%
Not for you, the bread
in the sweat of thy face.

01:56:34.327 --> 01:56:40.100 align:middle line:90%
For you, the only resort
is thieving, crime.

01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:41.782 align:middle line:84%
Same as mine!

01:56:41.782 --> 01:57:21.276 align:middle line:84%
All thanks to your father.

01:57:21.276 --> 01:57:24.351 align:middle line:84%
Watch your step, son.

01:57:24.351 --> 01:57:28.323 align:middle line:90%
I try. But what to do?
Out on the streets...

01:57:28.323 --> 01:57:57.942 align:middle line:90%
...there are those big guns like you.
- Sharp, are you?

01:57:57.942 --> 01:58:12.234 align:middle line:84%
Wow Dewan sir, how nicely you said!

01:58:12.234 --> 01:58:14.776 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen Rita?

01:58:14.776 --> 01:58:19.978 align:middle line:84%
I will show you.

01:58:19.978 --> 01:58:21.942 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:21.942 --> 01:58:23.855 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:23.855 --> 01:58:25.525 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:25.525 --> 01:58:27.525 align:middle line:84%
"And so say all of us."

01:58:27.525 --> 01:58:29.188 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

01:58:29.188 --> 01:58:30.942 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

01:58:30.942 --> 01:58:32.984 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:32.984 --> 01:58:34.730 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:34.730 --> 01:58:36.650 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:36.650 --> 01:58:38.521 align:middle line:84%
"And so say all of us."

01:58:38.521 --> 01:58:42.510 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:43.897 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:43.897 --> 01:58:45.772 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:45.772 --> 01:58:47.525 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:47.525 --> 01:58:49.273 align:middle line:84%
"And so say all of us."

01:58:49.273 --> 01:58:51.306 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

01:58:51.306 --> 01:58:53.750 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:54.859 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:54.859 --> 01:58:56.672 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:56.672 --> 01:58:58.480 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:00.313 align:middle line:84%
"And so say all of us."

01:59:00.313 --> 01:59:02.670 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

01:59:02.670 --> 01:59:04.600 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:05.814 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:59:05.814 --> 01:59:07.661 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:59:07.661 --> 01:59:09.517 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:59:09.517 --> 01:59:11.275 align:middle line:84%
"And so say all of us."

01:59:11.275 --> 01:59:13.147 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

01:59:13.147 --> 01:59:14.980 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:16.250 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:19.966 align:middle line:90%
Tell me something.
- What?

01:59:19.966 --> 01:59:25.389 align:middle line:84%
Who are you looking for?

01:59:25.389 --> 01:59:28.441 align:middle line:84%
Want me to tell you?

01:59:28.441 --> 01:59:37.109 align:middle line:84%
Look, over there.

01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:42.151 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

01:59:42.151 --> 01:59:46.567 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

01:59:46.567 --> 01:59:52.151 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

01:59:52.151 --> 01:59:55.734 align:middle line:84%
So you came.

01:59:55.734 --> 02:00:03.154 align:middle line:84%
Happy twenty-first.

02:00:03.154 --> 02:00:09.728 align:middle line:90%
Your gift.
- Why did you have to do this?

02:00:09.728 --> 02:00:13.484 align:middle line:90%
Why did you have to buy
such an expensive necklace?

02:00:13.484 --> 02:00:20.233 align:middle line:90%
For you, nothing is too expensive.
Besides, I stole it.

02:00:20.233 --> 02:00:25.612 align:middle line:90%
You stole it?
- I stole it from the stars.

02:00:25.612 --> 02:00:28.856 align:middle line:90%
You're such a...
- A savage?

02:00:28.856 --> 02:00:32.317 align:middle line:84%
What else? You are a savage.

02:00:32.317 --> 02:00:35.665 align:middle line:84%
You buy this expensive gift...

02:00:35.665 --> 02:00:40.161 align:middle line:90%
but you won't spend
for a velvet case.

02:00:40.161 --> 02:00:41.901 align:middle line:84%
Case?

02:00:41.901 --> 02:00:46.373 align:middle line:90%
Rita, the Judge is calling you.
Hurry up.

02:00:46.373 --> 02:00:53.146 align:middle line:84%
Coming.

02:00:53.146 --> 02:00:59.233 align:middle line:84%
What's on your mind?

02:00:59.233 --> 02:01:03.525 align:middle line:84%
Let me introduce you to the Judge.

02:01:03.525 --> 02:01:31.566 align:middle line:84%
Come on.

02:01:31.566 --> 02:01:34.853 align:middle line:84%
Rita, I've been waiting for you.

02:01:34.853 --> 02:01:45.691 align:middle line:90%
First, my present.
- See if you like it.

02:01:45.691 --> 02:01:49.358 align:middle line:84%
Why, don't you like it?

02:01:49.358 --> 02:01:53.358 align:middle line:90%
Today's a strange day. Someone
gives me a necklace sans a case.

02:01:53.358 --> 02:02:15.905 align:middle line:90%
And someone give me a case
sans the necklace.

02:02:15.905 --> 02:02:22.233 align:middle line:90%
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

02:02:22.233 --> 02:02:27.719 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:02:27.719 --> 02:02:34.350 align:middle line:90%
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:50.978 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:02:50.978 --> 02:02:56.784 align:middle line:90%
"A man with an innocent face,
turned out to be a thief."

02:02:56.784 --> 02:03:02.684 align:middle line:90%
"He hides the darkness inside,
but his face is bright."

02:03:02.684 --> 02:03:08.532 align:middle line:90%
"A man with an innocent face,
turned out to be a thief."

02:03:08.532 --> 02:03:13.597 align:middle line:90%
"He hides the darkness inside,
but his face is bright."

02:03:13.597 --> 02:03:19.771 align:middle line:90%
"I gave my heart,
I made myself fervent."

02:03:19.771 --> 02:03:25.255 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:03:25.255 --> 02:03:31.579 align:middle line:90%
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

02:03:31.579 --> 02:03:44.140 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:49.381 align:middle line:90%
"I was betrayed,
by his cobalt blue eyes."

02:03:49.381 --> 02:03:56.400 align:middle line:84%
"The cobalt blue eyes."

02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:01.473 align:middle line:90%
"I was betrayed,
by his cobalt blue eyes."

02:04:01.473 --> 02:04:04.952 align:middle line:84%
"The cobalt blue eyes."

02:04:04.952 --> 02:04:10.770 align:middle line:90%
"The heart is lonely,
the eyes are wet."

02:04:10.770 --> 02:04:13.165 align:middle line:84%
"The eyes are wet."

02:04:13.165 --> 02:04:19.271 align:middle line:90%
"I trusted him.
I proposed my love to him."

02:04:19.271 --> 02:04:24.690 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:31.600 align:middle line:90%
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:46.153 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:04:46.153 --> 02:04:50.867 align:middle line:84%
Rita, what have you done?

02:04:50.867 --> 02:04:54.703 align:middle line:84%
Fallen in love with a thief?

02:04:54.703 --> 02:04:59.389 align:middle line:84%
And Raju, you?

02:04:59.389 --> 02:05:03.956 align:middle line:84%
Is it some gift you don't like?

02:05:03.956 --> 02:05:13.422 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to return his gift.

02:05:13.422 --> 02:05:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Rita.

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:36.566 align:middle line:90%
Bring him over.
I'd like to meet him.

02:05:36.566 --> 02:05:40.729 align:middle line:90%
Raj isn't a bad boy.
He has just gone astray.

02:05:40.729 --> 02:05:47.301 align:middle line:90%
All he needs is someone to love him,
to support him, to bring him around.

02:05:47.301 --> 02:05:53.566 align:middle line:90%
He respects you. If you want it,
Raj can be saved.

02:05:53.566 --> 02:05:57.899 align:middle line:90%
Is Raj not at home?
- No. He went out early in the morning.

02:05:57.899 --> 02:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
He isn't back yet.

02:06:02.150 --> 02:06:20.601 align:middle line:84%
Okay, mother.

02:06:20.601 --> 02:06:26.240 align:middle line:90%
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:31.826 align:middle line:90%
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

02:06:31.826 --> 02:06:37.413 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:06:37.413 --> 02:06:42.816 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:06:42.816 --> 02:06:48.524 align:middle line:90%
"I happily endure the
perils of love."

02:06:48.524 --> 02:06:54.660 align:middle line:90%
"I happily endure the
perils of love."

02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:59.608 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:06:59.608 --> 02:07:13.524 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:07:13.524 --> 02:07:21.774 align:middle line:90%
"What do you know the
love of the heart!"

02:07:21.774 --> 02:07:30.650 align:middle line:90%
"A pain aroused, and my
eyes brimmed with tears."

02:07:30.650 --> 02:07:38.415 align:middle line:90%
"What do you know the
love of the heart!"

02:07:38.415 --> 02:07:43.966 align:middle line:90%
"A pain aroused, and my
eyes brimmed with tears."

02:07:43.966 --> 02:07:49.401 align:middle line:84%
"My eyes brimmed with tears."

02:07:49.401 --> 02:07:54.816 align:middle line:84%
"But I remained silent."

02:07:54.816 --> 02:08:00.441 align:middle line:90%
"But I remained silent,
I swear on this sadness."

02:08:00.441 --> 02:08:05.899 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:08:05.899 --> 02:08:19.737 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:08:19.737 --> 02:08:28.600 align:middle line:90%
"When the heart burned,
there was a fire."

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:36.228 align:middle line:84%
"When my tears flowed, it rained."

02:08:36.228 --> 02:08:44.636 align:middle line:90%
"When the heart burned,
there was a fire."

02:08:44.636 --> 02:08:50.146 align:middle line:84%
"When my tears flowed, it rained."

02:08:50.146 --> 02:08:55.633 align:middle line:84%
"It rained."

02:08:55.633 --> 02:09:01.167 align:middle line:84%
"Like a cloud."

02:09:01.167 --> 02:09:06.691 align:middle line:84%
"Like a cloud, I was a vagabond."

02:09:06.691 --> 02:09:12.271 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:09:12.271 --> 02:09:17.734 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:09:17.734 --> 02:09:23.276 align:middle line:90%
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

02:09:23.276 --> 02:09:28.819 align:middle line:90%
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

02:09:28.819 --> 02:09:34.370 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:43.121 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:09:43.121 --> 02:09:47.204 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:09:47.204 --> 02:09:52.890 align:middle line:90%
There you are. Haven't you
brought the police along?

02:09:52.890 --> 02:09:56.515 align:middle line:84%
That bitterness is of no use.

02:09:56.515 --> 02:10:01.337 align:middle line:84%
Your mother has told me everything.

02:10:01.337 --> 02:10:07.179 align:middle line:90%
So you know I'm vagabond,
I've been to jail...

02:10:07.179 --> 02:10:12.440 align:middle line:90%
...and my name is on the police rolls.
Is that what you've come to tell me?

02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:19.299 align:middle line:90%
Try to understand me, Raj.
I still consider you my friend.

02:10:19.299 --> 02:10:22.646 align:middle line:84%
Friend?

02:10:22.646 --> 02:10:29.933 align:middle line:90%
A lawyer's daughter, a judge's ward
takes a tramp for a friend?

02:10:29.933 --> 02:10:34.233 align:middle line:90%
What's your society going to say?
What will your people say?

02:10:34.233 --> 02:10:37.708 align:middle line:90%
If you recant, society
will forgive your past.

02:10:37.708 --> 02:10:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Raj, you can make a new life
for yourself... you can!

02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:48.162 align:middle line:90%
A new life? On what
will I build a new life?

02:10:48.162 --> 02:10:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Can you give me back my childhood,
the education I never had?

02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:59.554 align:middle line:90%
Everyone says that I have no father
to name... I have no honour!

02:10:59.554 --> 02:11:03.354 align:middle line:90%
Can you bring my father back?
Can you give me my name?

02:11:03.354 --> 02:11:09.589 align:middle line:90%
Can you give me my honour?
Tell me... tell me Rita!

02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Why are you quiet?

02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:19.726 align:middle line:90%
Rita, I've kept you in the dark.
I've kept myself in the dark.

02:11:19.726 --> 02:11:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Forget me Rita.
Leave me to myself.

02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:27.410 align:middle line:84%
I am not worthy of you.

02:11:27.410 --> 02:11:29.620 align:middle line:90%
You realise fully well,
yet you want to live in this hell.

02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:32.815 align:middle line:84%
I never imagined you'd be so weak.

02:11:32.815 --> 02:11:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Rita, don't you think I never tried
to get out of this hell.

02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:39.588 align:middle line:84%
But tell me, what do I do?

02:11:39.588 --> 02:11:43.416 align:middle line:90%
For twelve years, the world
has chased me towards crime.

02:11:43.416 --> 02:11:46.652 align:middle line:84%
Alone, I cannot face it.

02:11:46.652 --> 02:11:50.137 align:middle line:84%
Alone, I cannot.

02:11:50.137 --> 02:11:55.289 align:middle line:90%
You aren't alone, Raj.
Your mother is with you.

02:11:55.289 --> 02:12:01.623 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.
- You? With me? With a criminal?

02:12:01.623 --> 02:12:07.317 align:middle line:84%
Yes Raj. With you, forever.

02:12:07.317 --> 02:12:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Good or not, guilty or not,
whatever you are, you're mine.

02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:23.740 align:middle line:90%
This is a matter of the heart. And
the scales of justice cannot judge it.

02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:29.859 align:middle line:90%
But this guilt I carry
with me forever?

02:12:29.859 --> 02:12:38.229 align:middle line:90%
For me, as your wife, it will
be the bride's vermillion.

02:12:38.229 --> 02:12:41.345 align:middle line:84%
Really?

02:12:41.345 --> 02:12:44.437 align:middle line:90%
Come with me.
- Where?

02:12:44.437 --> 02:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
The Judge wants to meet you.

02:12:48.460 --> 02:13:07.817 align:middle line:90%
The Judge?
- Yes.

02:13:07.817 --> 02:13:18.604 align:middle line:84%
Sit.

02:13:18.604 --> 02:13:20.794 align:middle line:84%
Name?

02:13:20.794 --> 02:13:22.553 align:middle line:84%
Raj.

02:13:22.553 --> 02:13:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Only Raj?
- Yes.

02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:31.783 align:middle line:84%
Your father's name?

02:13:31.783 --> 02:13:41.387 align:middle line:84%
I don't know.

02:13:41.387 --> 02:13:44.643 align:middle line:90%
I see.
What do you do?

02:13:44.643 --> 02:13:49.300 align:middle line:90%
As of now, unemployed.
Like millions of others.

02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:55.313 align:middle line:90%
Any other source of income?
Property?

02:13:55.313 --> 02:13:56.781 align:middle line:84%
Nothing.

02:13:56.781 --> 02:14:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember polishing boots
when you were a boy?

02:14:02.130 --> 02:14:04.621 align:middle line:84%
I still do.

02:14:04.621 --> 02:14:10.800 align:middle line:90%
And you want to marry Rita?
- Yes. If you allow me.

02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:13.496 align:middle line:90%
And you've been to jail too?
- Rita must've told you that...

02:14:13.496 --> 02:14:18.416 align:middle line:90%
You've recanted? Have you found
another source of making money?

02:14:18.416 --> 02:14:23.820 align:middle line:90%
No.
- But there's still hope, isn't it?

02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:29.612 align:middle line:90%
If some silly rich girl marries you...
- Did you call me here to insult me?

02:14:29.612 --> 02:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Judge sir..

02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:36.182 align:middle line:84%
We are in love.

02:14:36.182 --> 02:14:39.972 align:middle line:90%
We want to marry.
- All that I've heard.

02:14:39.972 --> 02:14:43.981 align:middle line:84%
Love!

02:14:43.981 --> 02:14:46.827 align:middle line:84%
Sit.

02:14:46.827 --> 02:14:49.414 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk it over
with a cool head.

02:14:49.414 --> 02:14:52.464 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?
- I mean that though I don't know...

02:14:52.464 --> 02:14:55.748 align:middle line:90%
..how you managed to seduce
a naive girl..

02:14:55.748 --> 02:14:59.745 align:middle line:84%
..it's clear why you played this trick.

02:14:59.745 --> 02:15:06.803 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what price
you'll take to let her go.

02:15:06.803 --> 02:15:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Judge Raghunath.

02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:16.405 align:middle line:90%
Till today, I thought
I was the worst scoundrel on earth.

02:15:16.405 --> 02:15:19.324 align:middle line:90%
But you turn out to be
one up on me!

02:15:19.324 --> 02:15:23.282 align:middle line:90%
You scum! How dare you use
your filthy colloquy?

02:15:23.282 --> 02:15:27.303 align:middle line:90%
You think I'm going to let
Rita marry a tramp like you?

02:15:27.303 --> 02:15:33.190 align:middle line:90%
She'd rather stay a spinster for life.
Better by far that she dies!

02:15:33.190 --> 02:15:40.644 align:middle line:90%
Why not say that you'd rather
she married some rich big-shot?

02:15:40.644 --> 02:15:59.371 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe, some judge?
- Out of here. Get out.

02:15:59.371 --> 02:16:03.954 align:middle line:90%
Before I leave, I'd like
to ask you a question.

02:16:03.954 --> 02:16:08.781 align:middle line:90%
What if it was your son in my place?
And because he's poor...

02:16:08.781 --> 02:16:15.893 align:middle line:90%
..because he was brought up in the slums
and was forced into crime...

02:16:15.893 --> 02:16:19.310 align:middle line:90%
...what if it was he who was being
denied his love, his life?

02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:33.655 align:middle line:84%
How would you have felt?

02:16:33.655 --> 02:16:38.538 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:16:38.538 --> 02:16:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Raj! Raj!

02:16:40.450 --> 02:16:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Jagga has called you.

02:16:43.370 --> 02:17:21.977 align:middle line:90%
There's a big heist.
A bank is to be looted.

02:17:21.977 --> 02:17:25.664 align:middle line:84%
Open the door!

02:17:25.664 --> 02:17:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Open up.
- Who is it?

02:17:28.330 --> 02:17:31.144 align:middle line:84%
Open up!

02:17:31.144 --> 02:17:36.563 align:middle line:84%
Open the door!

02:17:36.563 --> 02:17:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Who is there?
- Open the door!

02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:48.948 align:middle line:84%
Who are you?

02:17:48.948 --> 02:17:52.755 align:middle line:84%
Don't you know me?

02:17:52.755 --> 02:17:56.441 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jagga.

02:17:56.441 --> 02:17:58.775 align:middle line:84%
Jagga!

02:17:58.775 --> 02:18:03.316 align:middle line:90%
The bandit?
- You could say so.

02:18:03.316 --> 02:18:08.775 align:middle line:90%
What do you want here?
- Silence!

02:18:08.775 --> 02:18:14.188 align:middle line:90%
The police are after me.
Where's Raj?

02:18:14.188 --> 02:18:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Get out of my house! I will do nothing
to help someone like you!

02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:30.310 align:middle line:90%
I had you once, and I let you go
Remember the day?

02:18:30.310 --> 02:18:35.975 align:middle line:90%
For twelve years, I cared for your son.
I made his life! For this day?

02:18:35.975 --> 02:18:40.787 align:middle line:90%
Made my son's life?
You forced him into crime.

02:18:40.787 --> 02:18:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Get out of my house. I don't want
your cursed shadow upon my son!

02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:47.609 align:middle line:84%
Get out! Get out of my house!

02:18:47.609 --> 02:18:53.984 align:middle line:84%
Police! Police!

02:18:53.984 --> 02:18:56.941 align:middle line:90%
Go on! Call the police!
- Police!

02:18:56.941 --> 02:19:01.236 align:middle line:90%
Let me see who saves you!
Scream!

02:19:01.236 --> 02:19:07.947 align:middle line:84%
Jagga!

02:19:07.947 --> 02:19:16.584 align:middle line:90%
Will you challenge your boss?
- You're no boss. You're Satan!

02:19:16.584 --> 02:19:28.281 align:middle line:84%
Satan!

02:19:28.281 --> 02:19:55.518 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear what you have to say now.

02:19:55.518 --> 02:19:59.679 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:19:59.679 --> 02:20:06.769 align:middle line:84%
Raj! No! No! Mercy!

02:20:06.769 --> 02:20:09.893 align:middle line:84%
No! Enough!

02:20:09.893 --> 02:20:44.856 align:middle line:84%
Jagga!

02:20:44.856 --> 02:21:05.849 align:middle line:90%
What have you done Raj?
- For my sins, this is atonement!

02:21:05.849 --> 02:21:23.885 align:middle line:84%
Police!

02:21:23.885 --> 02:21:33.324 align:middle line:84%
The accused may be presented.

02:21:33.324 --> 02:21:43.522 align:middle line:90%
What's the name of the accused?
- Sir, his name is Raj.

02:21:43.522 --> 02:21:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Father's name?
- Not known, sir. Maybe he has none.

02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:53.315 align:middle line:84%
Order!

02:21:53.315 --> 02:21:59.667 align:middle line:90%
Raj, you have been accused
of killing Jagga.

02:21:59.667 --> 02:22:05.102 align:middle line:90%
Do you have anything to say
in your defence?

02:22:05.102 --> 02:22:13.856 align:middle line:90%
Have you not appointed a lawyer
to defend yourself?

02:22:13.856 --> 02:22:19.505 align:middle line:90%
The case is adjourned. The government
will appoint a counsel for the defence.

02:22:19.505 --> 02:22:25.487 align:middle line:90%
I know the law. Raj killed
in self-defence. That's no crime.

02:22:25.487 --> 02:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Please save my Raj, somehow.

02:22:29.490 --> 02:22:33.132 align:middle line:90%
Your deposition is very important.
The whole case hinges on it.

02:22:33.132 --> 02:22:55.912 align:middle line:90%
Come to the court tomorrow.
- All right. Okay, dear.

02:22:55.912 --> 02:23:02.787 align:middle line:84%
Husband!

02:23:02.787 --> 02:23:04.135 align:middle line:84%
She is unconscious.

02:23:04.135 --> 02:23:08.305 align:middle line:84%
Move back! Move! Move!

02:23:08.305 --> 02:23:13.707 align:middle line:90%
Is she dead?
- She has been hurt on the head.

02:23:13.707 --> 02:23:22.662 align:middle line:90%
And Raj killed Jagga
to save my life.

02:23:22.662 --> 02:23:28.813 align:middle line:90%
Please sign here. This deposition
will surely save Raj.

02:23:28.813 --> 02:23:34.870 align:middle line:90%
If Raj is saved, I will be able
to die in peace.

02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:49.829 align:middle line:84%
I should be leaving now.

02:23:49.829 --> 02:23:51.617 align:middle line:84%
Mother!

02:23:51.617 --> 02:23:53.537 align:middle line:90%
My son!
- What happened to you, Ma?

02:23:53.537 --> 02:23:54.745 align:middle line:84%
My son!

02:23:54.745 --> 02:23:59.245 align:middle line:90%
That heartless judge has killed you!
What is his enmity with us?

02:23:59.245 --> 02:24:01.656 align:middle line:90%
You mustn't blame him, son.
- Why not?

02:24:01.656 --> 02:24:03.459 align:middle line:90%
He has always been tying
to make us miserable.

02:24:03.459 --> 02:24:08.887 align:middle line:84%
No son! He is your father.

02:24:08.887 --> 02:24:11.103 align:middle line:84%
My father?

02:24:11.103 --> 02:24:16.135 align:middle line:90%
What are you saying, Ma?
What has come over you?

02:24:16.135 --> 02:24:21.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not out of my mind, son.
What I'm saying is the truth.

02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:24.746 align:middle line:90%
I could not bring myself
to tell you this until now.

02:24:24.746 --> 02:24:31.106 align:middle line:90%
But if not today, once I'm gone
who else could tell you?

02:24:31.106 --> 02:24:35.518 align:middle line:90%
This can't be, Ma!
This can never be!

02:24:35.518 --> 02:24:41.597 align:middle line:90%
This is a long story.
But I don't have the time.

02:24:41.597 --> 02:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Keep this. I'm leaving.

02:24:47.850 --> 02:24:51.950 align:middle line:90%
He will surely recognise you
when you show him this.

02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:56.684 align:middle line:84%
He has never forgiven me.

02:24:56.684 --> 02:25:03.536 align:middle line:84%
But he will surely forgive his son.

02:25:03.536 --> 02:25:07.510 align:middle line:90%
I won't seek mercy from the one
who tortured my mother all her life...

02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:14.198 align:middle line:90%
..the one who made her beg from door
to door. I won't have his mercy!

02:25:14.198 --> 02:25:16.943 align:middle line:84%
Ma, I won't have his mercy!

02:25:16.943 --> 02:25:23.118 align:middle line:90%
If I could see him for
once before I died...

02:25:23.118 --> 02:25:25.414 align:middle line:84%
But why would he come here.

02:25:25.414 --> 02:25:29.177 align:middle line:90%
Come.
- I'm leaving Ma.

02:25:29.177 --> 02:25:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Son!

02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:32.927 align:middle line:90%
I'll avenge you, I will.
- No!

02:25:32.927 --> 02:25:35.751 align:middle line:90%
I'll surely avenge you, I will.
- No, son!.

02:25:35.751 --> 02:25:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Son!

02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:48.552 align:middle line:84%
The Judge is here to see you.

02:25:48.552 --> 02:26:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Which Judge?
- The one whose car ran you over.

02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:05.639 align:middle line:84%
So he has come... before I'm dead.

02:26:05.639 --> 02:26:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Alas, I cannot see.

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:15.316 align:middle line:84%
Nurse, give him my greetings.

02:26:15.316 --> 02:26:21.219 align:middle line:90%
I am ashamed about the accident.
Please forgive me.

02:26:21.219 --> 02:26:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Forgive you?

02:26:32.300 --> 02:27:12.934 align:middle line:84%
Doctor!

02:27:12.934 --> 02:27:15.458 align:middle line:84%
Mother!

02:27:15.458 --> 02:27:20.250 align:middle line:84%
You didn't die! You were killed!

02:27:20.250 --> 02:27:49.831 align:middle line:90%
That heartless judge has killed you!
To make sure that he isn't exposed!

02:27:49.831 --> 02:28:03.179 align:middle line:84%
Judge sir!

02:28:03.179 --> 02:28:05.323 align:middle line:84%
Judge sir!

02:28:05.323 --> 02:28:11.837 align:middle line:90%
Have you decided the verdict
about the case?

02:28:11.837 --> 02:28:17.627 align:middle line:90%
Case?
- Raj's case.

02:28:17.627 --> 02:28:22.994 align:middle line:90%
You are going mad!
What are you doing to yourself?

02:28:22.994 --> 02:28:26.680 align:middle line:84%
You are a mature, educated woman.

02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:29.846 align:middle line:90%
In a few days, you'll start
going to court as a lawyer.

02:28:29.846 --> 02:28:37.174 align:middle line:90%
You might even make a judge.
If you get emotional over every case...

02:28:37.174 --> 02:28:38.820 align:middle line:90%
..you will never be able to
dispense justice.

02:28:38.820 --> 02:28:46.253 align:middle line:90%
This is not a lawsuit.
It's my life!

02:28:46.253 --> 02:28:51.426 align:middle line:90%
Do you not understand as much?
- Irrespective, it won't alter the law.

02:28:51.426 --> 02:28:53.476 align:middle line:90%
Nor should you let your emotions
come in the way of justice.

02:28:53.476 --> 02:28:57.716 align:middle line:90%
Justice is all I seek.
Raj is completely innocent.

02:28:57.716 --> 02:29:00.491 align:middle line:90%
He killed Jagga tying to save
his mother.

02:29:00.491 --> 02:29:04.244 align:middle line:90%
You can read his mother's
dying declaration.

02:29:04.244 --> 02:29:07.491 align:middle line:90%
In this particular case,
Raj might merit pardon.

02:29:07.491 --> 02:29:11.372 align:middle line:90%
But his whole life is a long story
of involvement with crime and sin.

02:29:11.372 --> 02:29:16.959 align:middle line:90%
I cannot comprehend how you can
sympathise with such a person.

02:29:16.959 --> 02:29:21.234 align:middle line:84%
How can you love him?

02:29:21.234 --> 02:29:31.519 align:middle line:84%
You have studied the law.

02:29:31.519 --> 02:29:37.403 align:middle line:84%
But my heart has not read the laws.

02:29:37.403 --> 02:29:43.396 align:middle line:84%
Heart... and the laws.

02:29:43.396 --> 02:29:49.880 align:middle line:84%
The laws... and the heart.

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:53.645 align:middle line:84%
What a strange concoction.

02:29:53.645 --> 02:29:57.754 align:middle line:84%
But you are right.

02:29:57.754 --> 02:30:01.756 align:middle line:84%
The heart heeds no laws.

02:30:01.756 --> 02:30:05.821 align:middle line:84%
No laws at all.

02:30:05.821 --> 02:30:26.735 align:middle line:84%
Not even mine.

02:30:26.735 --> 02:30:31.307 align:middle line:90%
No!
- Get out, Rita.

02:30:31.307 --> 02:30:34.936 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a murderous rage!
- Have you gone mad?

02:30:34.936 --> 02:30:38.917 align:middle line:90%
So you have escaped?
- Yes.

02:30:38.917 --> 02:30:40.321 align:middle line:84%
To settle the score with you.

02:30:40.321 --> 02:30:41.156 align:middle line:84%
Raj..

02:30:41.156 --> 02:30:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Then you will be happy to know
that your lawyer...

02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:51.687 align:middle line:90%
...had just convinced me
about your innocence.

02:30:51.687 --> 02:30:55.268 align:middle line:90%
I was inclined to let you off
tomorrow.

02:30:55.268 --> 02:30:57.978 align:middle line:84%
I want no mercy from you.

02:30:57.978 --> 02:31:01.691 align:middle line:90%
I don't want your justice,
your law, nothing!

02:31:01.691 --> 02:31:06.908 align:middle line:84%
All I want...

02:31:06.908 --> 02:31:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Lost your nerve?
You need guts to kill someone.

02:31:12.890 --> 02:31:19.733 align:middle line:90%
You should be thanking the one
who has just saved your life.

02:31:19.733 --> 02:31:22.513 align:middle line:90%
What if I were to use this very knife
to rip your heart out?

02:31:22.513 --> 02:31:25.900 align:middle line:90%
What else can the verdict
of the courts be?

02:31:25.900 --> 02:31:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Judge Raghunath was compelled to kill
a criminal to save his own life.

02:31:29.630 --> 02:31:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Have you gone out of your mind too?
- I was. For a second.

02:31:40.640 --> 02:31:47.120 align:middle line:90%
For the scum that he is,
the hangman's noose will be better.

02:31:47.120 --> 02:31:51.907 align:middle line:84%
Raj. Raj.

02:31:51.907 --> 02:31:55.197 align:middle line:90%
This is the story of
Raj's life and crimes.

02:31:55.197 --> 02:32:00.502 align:middle line:90%
Now you know why and how
he took to crime.

02:32:00.502 --> 02:32:04.892 align:middle line:90%
My Lord, the one who is guilty
is his father...

02:32:04.892 --> 02:32:09.144 align:middle line:90%
..who drove an innocent woman from
his house, and denied his own son.

02:32:09.144 --> 02:32:11.610 align:middle line:90%
He is the one who forced them
to go begging from door to door.

02:32:11.610 --> 02:32:16.228 align:middle line:90%
And in the company of criminals,
he went astray.

02:32:16.228 --> 02:32:18.933 align:middle line:84%
My Lord and members of the Jury...

02:32:18.933 --> 02:32:21.353 align:middle line:90%
..if Raj is to be punished
for his crime..

02:32:21.353 --> 02:32:23.595 align:middle line:90%
..then his father should be
punished too.

02:32:23.595 --> 02:32:27.993 align:middle line:84%
My Lord, I would like to say something.

02:32:27.993 --> 02:32:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Emotion has got the better
of the counsel for defence.

02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:36.803 align:middle line:90%
In her anxiety to save the accused,
the counsel has presented...

02:32:36.803 --> 02:32:42.659 align:middle line:90%
..an interesting story,
however incongruous it might be...

02:32:42.659 --> 02:32:47.928 align:middle line:90%
..to try and prove that
some criminal happens to be my son!

02:32:47.928 --> 02:32:53.110 align:middle line:90%
But I ask, what evidence
does the counsel have?

02:32:53.110 --> 02:32:56.303 align:middle line:90%
No evidence on earth will convince you
that Raj is your son...

02:32:56.303 --> 02:32:59.553 align:middle line:90%
..not unless you are willing
to accept him as your son.

02:32:59.553 --> 02:33:04.898 align:middle line:90%
If there be proof, it lies deep
in your heart and in Raj's eyes.

02:33:04.898 --> 02:33:09.552 align:middle line:90%
Look at him. The same eyes,
the same high brow.

02:33:09.552 --> 02:33:13.654 align:middle line:90%
He even speaks like you speak.
He's just as adamant as you are.

02:33:13.654 --> 02:33:16.223 align:middle line:90%
Are you still not willing
to accept him as your son?

02:33:16.223 --> 02:33:19.739 align:middle line:84%
Ms Rita, the law heeds no emotion.

02:33:19.739 --> 02:33:24.781 align:middle line:90%
Nor my Lord, does the heart
heed any law.

02:33:24.781 --> 02:33:29.786 align:middle line:84%
I have no more to say.

02:33:29.786 --> 02:33:42.435 align:middle line:90%
If the accused has anything to say
in his defence, he may proceed.

02:33:42.435 --> 02:33:49.601 align:middle line:90%
Yes. At last,
after being branded a murderer...

02:33:49.601 --> 02:33:53.278 align:middle line:84%
..I hold your attention.

02:33:53.278 --> 02:34:00.286 align:middle line:90%
Had I been heard earlier, perhaps
I would never have had to stand here.

02:34:00.286 --> 02:34:03.436 align:middle line:90%
Ms Rita has tried her best
to save me from being hanged.

02:34:03.436 --> 02:34:06.582 align:middle line:90%
And not only in this particular case;
in my personal life too.

02:34:06.582 --> 02:34:11.967 align:middle line:90%
In my defence, I wish to say nothing.
I am evil.

02:34:11.967 --> 02:34:14.174 align:middle line:90%
I've been a vagabond ever since
I was a child.

02:34:14.174 --> 02:34:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm a murderer, a criminal.

02:34:17.550 --> 02:34:22.383 align:middle line:90%
You may punish me as you please.
But sin, crime, hatred and violence...

02:34:22.383 --> 02:34:25.508 align:middle line:90%
..this vicious circle that holds
your society in a vice-grip...

02:34:25.508 --> 02:34:28.557 align:middle line:90%
..do you think it can be broken
by hanging me?

02:34:28.557 --> 02:34:31.467 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to tell you
the story of my life.

02:34:31.467 --> 02:34:39.360 align:middle line:90%
But all I want to say is, I did not
inherit crime from my parents.

02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:41.383 align:middle line:90%
From that gutter full of filth
that flows beside my shanty...

02:34:41.383 --> 02:34:47.633 align:middle line:90%
...I picked up crime. That gutter
is still flowing over.

02:34:47.633 --> 02:34:52.592 align:middle line:84%
And the virus still breeds.

02:34:52.592 --> 02:34:56.467 align:middle line:90%
And countless children who live
in those slums...

02:34:56.467 --> 02:34:59.202 align:middle line:90%
..are falling prey to the virus
every day.

02:34:59.202 --> 02:35:06.336 align:middle line:90%
Do not think of me. Those children
are the ones you must care for.

02:35:06.336 --> 02:35:09.688 align:middle line:84%
You must care for your children.

02:35:09.688 --> 02:35:13.911 align:middle line:90%
Lest come the day when...
yours...

02:35:13.911 --> 02:35:15.794 align:middle line:84%
..and yours...

02:35:15.794 --> 02:35:19.410 align:middle line:84%
..and yours...

02:35:19.410 --> 02:35:21.505 align:middle line:90%
..and your son too stands
in these docks to reiterate...

02:35:21.505 --> 02:35:26.229 align:middle line:90%
..that it's an honest father's blood
that flows in my veins.

02:35:26.229 --> 02:35:31.313 align:middle line:90%
Time was when I was an innocent boy,
just like your sons.

02:35:31.313 --> 02:35:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Like all mothers, my mother too
wove a golden dream for me.

02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:41.923 align:middle line:90%
She would say, "My son will grow up
to become a lawyer".

02:35:41.923 --> 02:35:50.236 align:middle line:90%
Then he will become a magistrate.
And then, a judge... like his father.

02:35:50.236 --> 02:35:53.650 align:middle line:90%
I know the verdict that this court
is about to give.

02:35:53.650 --> 02:36:00.840 align:middle line:90%
And I'm willing to suffer any sentence.
For my sins, this is atonement.

02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:05.270 align:middle line:90%
But I await the decision
from yet another quarter.

02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:11.957 align:middle line:90%
I want to know Judge Raghunath,
what says your heart?

02:36:11.957 --> 02:36:38.631 align:middle line:84%
What says your heart?

02:36:38.631 --> 02:37:25.548 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:37:25.548 --> 02:37:30.954 align:middle line:84%
Has the Judge come to see his convict?

02:37:30.954 --> 02:37:34.590 align:middle line:84%
A father...

02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:37.623 align:middle line:84%
..who is guilty.

02:37:37.623 --> 02:37:39.242 align:middle line:84%
Guilty? You?

02:37:39.242 --> 02:37:41.789 align:middle line:84%
Yes.

02:37:41.789 --> 02:37:46.706 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow, the law might
pronounce you guilty.

02:37:46.706 --> 02:37:54.110 align:middle line:90%
But in the eyes of God,
I am the one who is guilty.

02:37:54.110 --> 02:37:56.203 align:middle line:84%
Are you weeping?

02:37:56.203 --> 02:38:01.938 align:middle line:90%
Yes, for the father who found his son,
and yet he has lost him.

02:38:01.938 --> 02:38:04.525 align:middle line:90%
For the husband who forced his wife
to become a widow.

02:38:04.525 --> 02:38:07.684 align:middle line:90%
For society, where poverty
breeds crime.

02:38:07.684 --> 02:38:09.681 align:middle line:90%
For the son who is orphaned
though his father is alive.

02:38:09.681 --> 02:38:11.528 align:middle line:90%
For the child who goes through life
looking for someone...

02:38:11.528 --> 02:38:13.314 align:middle line:84%
..who will call him "Son".

02:38:13.314 --> 02:38:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Son.

02:38:17.430 --> 02:38:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Son!

02:38:22.770 --> 02:38:55.964 align:middle line:84%
Son!

02:38:55.964 --> 02:39:01.119 align:middle line:90%
Raj, son of Judge Raghunath,
you have been proved guilty...

02:39:01.119 --> 02:39:04.453 align:middle line:90%
..of tying to assassinate
your father, Judge Raghunath.

02:39:04.453 --> 02:39:08.913 align:middle line:90%
But in the light of the strange and
unfortunate circumstances your life...

02:39:08.913 --> 02:39:12.282 align:middle line:90%
..which your counsel Ms Rita
has presented...

02:39:12.282 --> 02:39:53.385 align:middle line:90%
..you are sentenced to only three years
of rigorous imprisonment.

02:39:53.385 --> 02:39:55.778 align:middle line:84%
Crying?

02:39:55.778 --> 02:39:57.784 align:middle line:84%
You silly girl.

02:39:57.784 --> 02:40:00.195 align:middle line:84%
Silly, lawyers never cry.

02:40:00.195 --> 02:40:02.808 align:middle line:90%
At this rate, how are you
going to practice?

02:40:02.808 --> 02:40:09.985 align:middle line:90%
What use is the practice, Raj?
I wasn't able to save you.

02:40:09.985 --> 02:40:16.178 align:middle line:90%
No Rita, this penance
is very important for me.

02:40:16.178 --> 02:40:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Only after I've been through this,
will I be worthy of you.

02:40:21.610 --> 02:40:26.666 align:middle line:90%
With you beside me,
I can go through anything.

02:40:26.666 --> 02:40:29.788 align:middle line:84%
I will become an honest man.

02:40:29.788 --> 02:40:33.219 align:middle line:84%
Everyone will say I'm a good man.

02:40:33.219 --> 02:40:37.661 align:middle line:84%
I will read, I will write.

02:40:37.661 --> 02:40:41.936 align:middle line:90%
And just like Ma used to say,
first I'll become a lawyer...

02:40:41.936 --> 02:40:46.930 align:middle line:84%
..then a magistrate.

02:40:46.930 --> 02:40:50.634 align:middle line:84%
And then, a judge.

02:40:50.634 --> 02:40:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Last night I saw a judge.
And I liked him.

02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:01.878 align:middle line:84%
I'll become a judge.

02:41:01.878 --> 02:41:04.341 align:middle line:90%
You won't call me a savage anymore,
will you?

02:41:04.341 --> 02:41:12.210 align:middle line:84%
I will. You savage!

02:41:12.210 --> 02:41:14.792 align:middle line:84%
Time up.

02:41:14.792 --> 02:41:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Come on.

02:41:30.940 --> 02:41:33.333 align:middle line:84%
Keep this.

02:41:33.333 --> 02:41:37.710 align:middle line:84%
It's your gift.

02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:40.556 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry. I didn't steal it.

02:41:40.556 --> 02:41:42.773 align:middle line:84%
I just smuggled it in.

02:41:42.773 --> 02:41:56.505 align:middle line:84%
Raj.

02:41:56.505 --> 02:42:04.644 align:middle line:90%
Not your fault, Rita.
It's just the way I look.

02:42:04.644 --> 02:42:06.315 align:middle line:84%
Raj.

02:42:06.315 --> 02:42:09.218 align:middle line:84%
Raj.

02:42:09.218 --> 02:42:15.757 align:middle line:90%
Three years isn't too long, Raj.
I'll wait for you.

02:42:15.757 --> 02:42:17.508 align:middle line:84%
Rita.

02:42:17.508 --> 02:42:25.659 align:middle line:90%
I'll wait for you!
- Don't cry.

02:42:25.659 --> 02:42:33.945 align:middle line:84%
Number 308... move it.

02:42:33.945 --> 02:42:52.261 align:middle line:84%
I should be.

02:42:52.261 --> 02:42:55.106 align:middle line:90%
"I'm not flourishing,
I am not ruined."

02:42:55.106 --> 02:42:57.947 align:middle line:84%
"Still I sing happy songs."

02:42:57.947 --> 02:43:02.820 align:middle line:84%
"Still I sing happy songs."

02:43:02.820 --> 02:43:04.889 align:middle line:84%
"My heart is filled with wounds."

02:43:04.889 --> 02:43:10.782 align:middle line:84%
"But still these lively eyes smile."

02:43:10.782 --> 02:43:16.447 align:middle line:84%
"World.."

02:43:16.447 --> 02:43:27.757 align:middle line:90%
"World, I am troubled by your
sorrows or misfortunes."

02:43:27.757 --> 02:43:32.757 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond."
