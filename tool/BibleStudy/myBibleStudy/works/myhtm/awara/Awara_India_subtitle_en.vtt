00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:07.567 align:middle line:84%
Spice for the front page, isn't it?

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:10.717 align:middle line:90%
All you can think of are
headlines for the front page.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Oh, drop it!

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:27.974 align:middle line:84%
Here comes Judge Raghunath.

00:04:27.974 --> 00:04:32.972 align:middle line:90%
Such a gentleman! Why on earth
did that goon want to kill him?

00:04:32.972 --> 00:05:07.624 align:middle line:84%
Here comes your friend.

00:05:07.624 --> 00:05:11.443 align:middle line:90%
Is the jury in place?
- Yes, my Lord. Present.

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Is the accused present?
- Present, my Lord.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Who is the counsel for the accused?

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.637 align:middle line:84%
Who is the counsel for the accused?

00:05:26.637 --> 00:05:33.143 align:middle line:90%
Have you no lawyer
to defend your case?

00:05:33.143 --> 00:05:46.862 align:middle line:90%
In that case, the government...
- My Lord.

00:05:46.862 --> 00:05:56.152 align:middle line:84%
I'm the counsel for the accused.

00:05:56.152 --> 00:05:59.137 align:middle line:84%
I do not wish to defend myself.

00:05:59.137 --> 00:06:06.941 align:middle line:90%
I promised to defend you,
if you're ever arraigned. Remember?

00:06:06.941 --> 00:06:15.201 align:middle line:84%
Does the accused give his consent?

00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:18.542 align:middle line:84%
Yes.

00:06:18.542 --> 00:06:25.631 align:middle line:90%
Raj, you have been accused of
a murderous attack on Judge Raghunath.

00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:34.988 align:middle line:84%
You may plead your case.

00:06:34.988 --> 00:06:41.748 align:middle line:84%
I swear to speak the truth.

00:06:41.748 --> 00:06:47.332 align:middle line:90%
Judge Raghunath, can you tell us
why the accused tried to kill you?

00:06:47.332 --> 00:06:49.634 align:middle line:84%
Did he have any enmity with you?

00:06:49.634 --> 00:06:56.523 align:middle line:90%
Yes. The grudge that a born
felon bears...

00:06:56.523 --> 00:07:02.107 align:middle line:90%
against the judge who sentences
him and grants no reprieve.

00:07:02.107 --> 00:07:05.177 align:middle line:90%
Could there be no other reason
for such animosity?

00:07:05.177 --> 00:07:12.328 align:middle line:84%
None. How else could I relate to him?

00:07:12.328 --> 00:07:16.117 align:middle line:84%
I have no further questions.

00:07:16.117 --> 00:07:30.677 align:middle line:90%
Defense may proceed with
cross-questioning.

00:07:30.677 --> 00:07:34.733 align:middle line:84%
Judge, you are senior to me.

00:07:34.733 --> 00:07:40.471 align:middle line:90%
If in the course of questioning,
I happen to affront you do forgive me.

00:07:40.471 --> 00:07:45.696 align:middle line:90%
Someone's life is at stake.
And you have taught me...

00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:53.575 align:middle line:90%
to ignore all relationships for
the dispensation of justice.

00:07:53.575 --> 00:08:03.252 align:middle line:90%
This is my first interrogation.
Please give me your blessings.

00:08:03.252 --> 00:08:08.413 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean when you call
the accused a born felon?

00:08:08.413 --> 00:08:10.929 align:middle line:84%
He has been a tramp and a hoodlum...

00:08:10.929 --> 00:08:13.781 align:middle line:90%
ever since he was a child.
His record says it.

00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:90%
This penchant for crime has surely
been transmitted congenitally.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.651 align:middle line:84%
Judge, do you have any children?

00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:22.515 align:middle line:84%
No

00:08:22.515 --> 00:08:25.369 align:middle line:90%
But how is this question relevant
to this case?

00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Most relevant. Think again. Are you
certain that you have no children?

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:37.688 align:middle line:90%
No. But I reiterate. This question...
- Can you recount the circumstance...

00:08:37.688 --> 00:08:42.213 align:middle line:90%
when you threw your wife
out of your house?

00:08:42.213 --> 00:08:47.377 align:middle line:90%
My Lord, am I to be forced to reply
to such meaningless questions?

00:08:47.377 --> 00:08:52.225 align:middle line:90%
Ms Rita, you may ask questions
relevant only to the case.

00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:55.806 align:middle line:90%
We wish to know whether or not,
the accused attempted murder.

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:57.350 align:middle line:84%
If yes, then why?

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:03.163 align:middle line:90%
Enough! Stop it! I'm a murderer!
Hang me if you will!

00:09:03.163 --> 00:09:05.367 align:middle line:84%
Order! Order!

00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:07.395 align:middle line:84%
Proceed with your questioning.

00:09:07.395 --> 00:09:11.536 align:middle line:90%
The accused does not deny having
assaulted Judge Raghunath.

00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:17.815 align:middle line:90%
But, as you said just now,
the question is why he did it.

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:20.472 align:middle line:90%
This interrogation is meant
to reveal the answer...

00:09:20.472 --> 00:09:25.844 align:middle line:90%
if you my Lord, and Judge Raghunath
repose your trust in me for a while

00:09:25.844 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:84%
You may proceed.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.917 align:middle line:90%
I repeat my question.
Can you recount the circumstance...

00:09:32.917 --> 00:09:37.236 align:middle line:90%
when you threw your wife
out of your house?

00:09:37.236 --> 00:09:41.884 align:middle line:90%
I beg your pardon, Judge Raghunath,
but this question is very important.

00:09:41.884 --> 00:09:44.842 align:middle line:90%
And not only for the accused.
For you too.

00:09:44.842 --> 00:09:49.716 align:middle line:90%
The cause of whatever is happening
today, lies rooted in your past.

00:09:49.716 --> 00:09:52.733 align:middle line:84%
Remember?

00:09:52.733 --> 00:09:55.512 align:middle line:84%
Remember?

00:09:55.512 --> 00:10:00.125 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us? Why, when
and under what circumstance...

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:03.367 align:middle line:90%
did you throw your wife
out of your house?

00:10:03.367 --> 00:10:06.192 align:middle line:84%
Why, when and under what circumstance...

00:10:06.192 --> 00:10:09.422 align:middle line:90%
..did you throw your wife
out of your house?

00:10:09.422 --> 00:10:12.244 align:middle line:84%
Why, when and under what circumstance...

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:90%
..did you throw your
wife out of your house?

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.686 align:middle line:84%
24 years ago...

00:10:17.686 --> 00:10:19.729 align:middle line:84%
I was practicing law in Lucknow.

00:10:19.729 --> 00:10:24.928 align:middle line:90%
I was the black sheep of the family,
because I opposed social norm...

00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:29.349 align:middle line:90%
and I had married a widow.
My father was a big gun.

00:10:29.349 --> 00:10:32.793 align:middle line:90%
And was away in Bombay most of the time.
He was unhappy with me.

00:10:32.793 --> 00:10:36.107 align:middle line:90%
But under no circumstance,
was I willing to leave Leela.

00:10:36.107 --> 00:10:40.402 align:middle line:90%
She was so good to me.
She was such a good woman.

00:10:40.402 --> 00:10:44.675 align:middle line:84%
And I was in love with her.

00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:48.215 align:middle line:90%
But once, on our way from
Kanpur to Allahabad...

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:50.709 align:middle line:90%
little did I realise that
like a boat in midstream...

00:10:50.709 --> 00:11:02.277 align:middle line:90%
my life too was to be caught
in cross currents.

00:11:02.277 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.455 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:11:14.455 --> 00:11:16.157 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:16.157 --> 00:11:18.935 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:11:18.935 --> 00:11:20.596 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:84%
"I can't think straight."

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.857 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:24.857 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
"I can't think straight."

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.695 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:28.695 --> 00:11:31.215 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:33.725 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:37.484 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:11:37.484 --> 00:11:46.908 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:11:46.908 --> 00:11:51.954 align:middle line:84%
"The clear open sky over the head."

00:11:51.954 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
"The clear open sky."

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.715 align:middle line:90%
"Be prudent, boatman.
There is storm in your boat."

00:12:00.715 --> 00:12:05.215 align:middle line:84%
"There is storm in your boat."

00:12:05.215 --> 00:12:07.448 align:middle line:84%
"The deep capricious waves."

00:12:07.448 --> 00:12:09.412 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:09.412 --> 00:12:11.643 align:middle line:84%
"The deep capricious waves."

00:12:11.643 --> 00:12:13.391 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:15.860 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:22.377 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:12:22.377 --> 00:12:30.737 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:12:30.737 --> 00:12:37.775 align:middle line:84%
"A piece of the glass floats away."

00:12:37.775 --> 00:12:44.547 align:middle line:84%
"The iron too drowns."

00:12:44.547 --> 00:12:46.816 align:middle line:84%
"What are you thinking?"

00:12:46.816 --> 00:12:48.774 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:48.774 --> 00:12:50.952 align:middle line:84%
"What are you thinking?"

00:12:50.952 --> 00:12:52.701 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:52.701 --> 00:12:55.132 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:12:55.132 --> 00:12:56.834 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:12:56.834 --> 00:12:59.268 align:middle line:90%
"The boat is stuck in the
middle of the ocean."

00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:01.195 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:05.380 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:48.817 align:middle line:84%
"Haul it, haul it, haul it."

00:13:48.817 --> 00:13:59.845 align:middle line:84%
"Be prudent, be prudent."

00:13:59.845 --> 00:14:03.688 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you feeling sleepy?

00:14:03.688 --> 00:14:08.883 align:middle line:90%
What are you thinking about?
- Why do they sing "Beware"?

00:14:08.883 --> 00:14:15.329 align:middle line:90%
They say, these parts are dangerous.
Jagga the bandit. He's from these parts.

00:14:15.329 --> 00:14:19.608 align:middle line:90%
Bandits?
- Yes, but don't worry.

00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:22.184 align:middle line:90%
As of now, he must be fast asleep
in some prison.

00:14:22.184 --> 00:14:30.234 align:middle line:84%
Go to bed. I'm feeling sleepy.

00:14:30.234 --> 00:14:38.322 align:middle line:90%
In case you're afraid, I can come over.
- No.

00:14:38.322 --> 00:14:46.582 align:middle line:84%
Leela!

00:14:46.582 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
No! The lady is with them!

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:35.204 align:middle line:84%
Leave me! Leave me! Leave me!

00:15:35.204 --> 00:15:39.402 align:middle line:84%
You heartless bandits!

00:15:39.402 --> 00:15:43.882 align:middle line:84%
Where's your chief?

00:15:43.882 --> 00:15:47.388 align:middle line:90%
What right have you to terrorise
women from good families?

00:15:47.388 --> 00:15:49.734 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you ashamed?
- Ashamed?

00:15:49.734 --> 00:15:53.611 align:middle line:90%
Shame is for good folks,
not for bandits and robbers.

00:15:53.611 --> 00:15:59.458 align:middle line:90%
As for me, my grandfather was a bandit,
my father was a bandit! But I wasn't.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:04.575 align:middle line:90%
And your husband went and made me one!
- My husband?

00:16:04.575 --> 00:16:08.713 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?
- Jagga. And I was innocent.

00:16:08.713 --> 00:16:14.214 align:middle line:90%
But without a shard of evidence,
your husband framed me...

00:16:14.214 --> 00:16:18.915 align:middle line:90%
just because my father, my grandfather
were bandits.

00:16:18.915 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:90%
He framed me for rape
and he sent me to jail.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:30.675 align:middle line:90%
So I've decided to prove
your husband right.

00:16:30.675 --> 00:16:38.492 align:middle line:84%
Coward!

00:16:38.492 --> 00:16:42.559 align:middle line:84%
See what's wrong with her.

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:45.788 align:middle line:84%
Has she come to her senses?

00:16:45.788 --> 00:16:50.503 align:middle line:84%
No, she's still in a swoon.

00:16:50.503 --> 00:16:56.134 align:middle line:90%
Let her go, Chief. She's pregnant.
She's going to become a mother.

00:16:56.134 --> 00:17:00.946 align:middle line:84%
Touch her, and you go to hell.

00:17:00.946 --> 00:17:06.881 align:middle line:84%
Pregnant? With a baby?

00:17:06.881 --> 00:17:14.598 align:middle line:90%
Her husband said that children born
of good folks turn out good.

00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:18.916 align:middle line:84%
And children born of bandits...

00:17:18.916 --> 00:17:22.442 align:middle line:84%
turn out to be bandits. Always.

00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:30.376 align:middle line:90%
Now let's see what the lawyer's son
turns out to be.

00:17:30.376 --> 00:17:35.545 align:middle line:84%
Send her back once she recovers.

00:17:35.545 --> 00:17:49.179 align:middle line:90%
Good are those born of good folks!
And of bandits are bandits born.

00:17:49.179 --> 00:17:52.202 align:middle line:90%
You should make me a gift.
- What's the occasion?

00:17:52.202 --> 00:17:55.689 align:middle line:90%
Not any occasion.
The lady is back.

00:17:55.689 --> 00:17:59.367 align:middle line:84%
What did you say? The lady?

00:17:59.367 --> 00:18:02.379 align:middle line:84%
Leela!

00:18:02.379 --> 00:18:07.214 align:middle line:84%
Leela!

00:18:07.214 --> 00:18:09.134 align:middle line:84%
Why is it dark in here?

00:18:09.134 --> 00:18:10.924 align:middle line:84%
Nathu! Bansi! Naina!

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:16.679 align:middle line:84%
Lights! Tonight we celebrate!

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:18.466 align:middle line:84%
Leela.

00:18:18.466 --> 00:18:23.793 align:middle line:84%
It is you who lights up my life.

00:18:23.793 --> 00:18:32.544 align:middle line:84%
Leela.

00:18:32.544 --> 00:18:36.452 align:middle line:90%
Now that you're back,
even the lights seem so bright!

00:18:36.452 --> 00:18:45.682 align:middle line:84%
Give me the wick.

00:18:45.682 --> 00:18:53.297 align:middle line:90%
But Leela, how did you escape?
I hope you weren't in danger?

00:18:53.297 --> 00:18:59.882 align:middle line:90%
Your love was with me.
How could anyone even look up at me?

00:18:59.882 --> 00:19:11.376 align:middle line:90%
You are tired. Change.
I'll bring you your dressing gown.

00:19:11.376 --> 00:19:17.773 align:middle line:84%
These last four days.

00:19:17.773 --> 00:19:22.645 align:middle line:90%
The last four days were
like a lifetime.

00:19:22.645 --> 00:19:25.483 align:middle line:90%
I took the police and I looked
everywhere for you.

00:19:25.483 --> 00:19:38.206 align:middle line:84%
All the while, I feared...

00:19:38.206 --> 00:19:49.904 align:middle line:84%
I feared you were in grave danger!

00:19:49.904 --> 00:19:55.746 align:middle line:90%
But how did you escape?
And who was this bandit?

00:19:55.746 --> 00:20:00.768 align:middle line:90%
Some Jagga.
He said that you had convicted him.

00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:03.106 align:middle line:84%
Jagga.

00:20:03.106 --> 00:20:09.549 align:middle line:90%
So he escaped to get even with me!
If he has done anything to you...

00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:90%
I'll see to it that he hangs!
- At heart, he's a devil.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:19.437 align:middle line:90%
But God saved me at the last moment.
Thank God!

00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:23.439 align:middle line:84%
Tell me something.

00:20:23.439 --> 00:20:25.283 align:middle line:84%
Ask.

00:20:25.283 --> 00:20:30.945 align:middle line:90%
Does a bandit's son necessarily
become a bandit?

00:20:30.945 --> 00:20:36.689 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's bound to happen.

00:20:36.689 --> 00:20:51.263 align:middle line:90%
But why do you ask?
- Just like that.

00:20:51.263 --> 00:20:56.295 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what comes first.
Your becoming a magistrate, or...

00:20:56.295 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Why? Is someone expected?

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.246 align:middle line:84%
A new guest.

00:21:03.246 --> 00:21:08.288 align:middle line:90%
Now I don't have any chances
of becoming a magistrate.

00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:11.733 align:middle line:84%
Why? What happened?

00:21:11.733 --> 00:21:22.225 align:middle line:90%
Whatever...
let's talk of something else.

00:21:22.225 --> 00:21:25.998 align:middle line:84%
How do you like this?

00:21:25.998 --> 00:21:27.908 align:middle line:84%
Nice.

00:21:27.908 --> 00:21:30.221 align:middle line:84%
Nice.

00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:37.194 align:middle line:90%
Listen...
Are you annoyed with me?

00:21:37.194 --> 00:21:41.245 align:middle line:84%
Annoyed? No.

00:21:41.245 --> 00:21:47.258 align:middle line:84%
Why should I be annoyed with you?

00:21:47.258 --> 00:21:58.592 align:middle line:84%
Have my lunch sent over.

00:21:58.592 --> 00:22:00.512 align:middle line:90%
What's the matter?
Where are the servants?

00:22:00.512 --> 00:22:04.643 align:middle line:90%
God knows! Maybe they're all dead!
I have to do all the chores.

00:22:04.643 --> 00:22:07.159 align:middle line:90%
Let me help you.
- You'd rather tell her all this.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:10.955 align:middle line:84%
She's sitting around like a queen!

00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:15.511 align:middle line:90%
Not to be cross with Leela.
I told her not to strain herself.

00:22:15.511 --> 00:22:19.959 align:middle line:90%
You know the condition she is in.
And in a few days from now...

00:22:19.959 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:90%
She's going to bear the fruit
of her sins!

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.293 align:middle line:90%
What are you saying?!
- What everyone else is saying!

00:22:29.293 --> 00:22:34.369 align:middle line:90%
For four days, she lived with a bandit!
And Jagga that!

00:22:34.369 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't you remember what
he was convicted for?

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.703 align:middle line:90%
Do you enjoy making someone unhappy?
The jaundiced eye sees all yellow.

00:22:41.703 --> 00:22:45.559 align:middle line:90%
Do you think you're beyond scrutiny?
Don't you forget...

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:47.628 align:middle line:90%
women have had to stand the test of
chastity. Because society asks for it.

00:22:47.628 --> 00:22:53.909 align:middle line:84%
Bhabhi! (Sister-in-law)

00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:56.889 align:middle line:90%
Forgive me Bhabhi,
your pot is broken.

00:22:56.889 --> 00:23:01.616 align:middle line:90%
It's only an earthen pot. But remember,
a woman's honour is far more fragile.

00:23:01.616 --> 00:23:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Once disgraced, her honour
can never be redeemed.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.343 align:middle line:84%
Just answer my question!

00:23:36.343 --> 00:23:39.835 align:middle line:90%
Did you not know that your wife
was seeing her lover on the sly?

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:44.314 align:middle line:90%
The villagers used to say that.
But I didn't heed what they said.

00:23:44.314 --> 00:23:47.969 align:middle line:90%
You haven't yet told the court
why your wife deserted you.

00:23:47.969 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:90%
You know it! Women are adulterous!
- I know what that means!

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:07.455 align:middle line:90%
Raghu, how can you lose
your cool in court?

00:24:07.455 --> 00:24:12.697 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid your chances of
magistrate ship may be clouded.

00:24:12.697 --> 00:24:21.469 align:middle line:90%
Chances of a magistrate ship?
That's out of question now.

00:24:21.469 --> 00:24:26.395 align:middle line:90%
Can a lawyer whose wife is under
suspicion ever become a magistrate?

00:24:26.395 --> 00:24:27.554 align:middle line:84%
Raghu!

00:24:27.554 --> 00:24:31.166 align:middle line:90%
The whole town is agog!
- What are you saying?

00:24:31.166 --> 00:24:35.273 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you ashamed to talk like this
about your wife?

00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:38.371 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying what everyone is saying.

00:24:38.371 --> 00:24:42.352 align:middle line:84%
Let them say what they want.

00:24:42.352 --> 00:24:48.441 align:middle line:84%
You're right. That's what I decided.

00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:51.409 align:middle line:84%
Let them say what they want.

00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:57.743 align:middle line:90%
But how do I get rid of the suspicion?
It's like a leech sucking on...

00:24:57.743 --> 00:25:20.411 align:middle line:90%
some dark corner of my mind!
- What now?

00:25:20.411 --> 00:25:25.374 align:middle line:84%
Nathu! Naina! Bhabhi!

00:25:25.374 --> 00:25:29.482 align:middle line:84%
Where's everyone?

00:25:29.482 --> 00:25:34.406 align:middle line:84%
Send Bhabhi over to me.

00:25:34.406 --> 00:25:38.337 align:middle line:84%
I am scared.

00:25:38.337 --> 00:25:42.228 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't someone coming to me?

00:25:42.228 --> 00:25:50.986 align:middle line:90%
That's my husband.
Please, send him over to me.

00:25:50.986 --> 00:25:54.372 align:middle line:84%
Look Raghu...

00:25:54.372 --> 00:25:57.136 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you again! That baby
isn't going to be born in this house

00:25:57.136 --> 00:26:00.460 align:middle line:90%
If she wants to have her bastard,
let her go elsewhere.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.152 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to let the honour
of my family be tainted.

00:26:03.152 --> 00:26:06.128 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to throw this
wanton woman out!

00:26:06.128 --> 00:26:10.383 align:middle line:90%
No! I'm not going anywhere!
No one can take me away from here!

00:26:10.383 --> 00:26:22.618 align:middle line:90%
He knows that I'm innocent!
He trusts me, he trusts me!

00:26:22.618 --> 00:26:26.852 align:middle line:84%
You're here! Now I'm afraid of no one!

00:26:26.852 --> 00:26:30.736 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard?
They want to throw me out!

00:26:30.736 --> 00:26:37.323 align:middle line:90%
They say I'm a wanton woman!
They say, I've no right to be here!

00:26:37.323 --> 00:26:42.406 align:middle line:90%
But now you're here.
No one will dare anymore.

00:26:42.406 --> 00:26:49.667 align:middle line:90%
Tell them I'm untainted!
Tell them you trust me.

00:26:49.667 --> 00:27:12.224 align:middle line:84%
Tell them I'm mothering your child.

00:27:12.224 --> 00:27:16.587 align:middle line:84%
Have you fallen for what they say?

00:27:16.587 --> 00:27:21.868 align:middle line:90%
You're the one who told me...
I don't care for the barking dogs.

00:27:21.868 --> 00:27:28.151 align:middle line:90%
If you desert me, who else
in this world can I turn to?

00:27:28.151 --> 00:27:33.677 align:middle line:84%
Tell me... tell me that you trust me!

00:27:33.677 --> 00:27:35.947 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you're above scrutiny?

00:27:35.947 --> 00:27:54.133 align:middle line:90%
Don't you forget women have
had to stand the test of chastity.

00:27:54.133 --> 00:28:00.654 align:middle line:90%
Why are you quiet?
Speak... speak!

00:28:00.654 --> 00:28:07.224 align:middle line:90%
You can see the state I'm in.
I'm afraid... afraid!

00:28:07.224 --> 00:28:14.102 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to become a mother
...the mother of your child.

00:28:14.102 --> 00:28:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Have mercy! This is your baby.
This baby is yours!

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:37.748 align:middle line:90%
Get out!
Get out of here!

00:28:37.748 --> 00:28:48.323 align:middle line:84%
"A dutiful wife like Sita."

00:28:48.323 --> 00:28:54.672 align:middle line:84%
"You gave exile to her."

00:28:54.672 --> 00:29:05.735 align:middle line:84%
"Why didn't the earth rip apart?"

00:29:05.735 --> 00:29:11.206 align:middle line:84%
"Why didn't the sky rip apart?"

00:29:11.206 --> 00:29:15.553 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:20.312 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:29:20.312 --> 00:29:24.682 align:middle line:84%
"The dear one of Lord Ram."

00:29:24.682 --> 00:29:28.104 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:29:28.104 --> 00:29:32.113 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:29:32.113 --> 00:29:36.207 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:40.788 align:middle line:84%
"Women have to endure injustice."

00:29:40.788 --> 00:29:45.136 align:middle line:84%
"Look, the King of the palace."

00:29:45.136 --> 00:29:48.233 align:middle line:84%
"What a game is he playing!"

00:29:48.233 --> 00:30:03.135 align:middle line:84%
"What a game is he playing!"

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:07.472 align:middle line:84%
"Look, the King of the palace."

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:10.556 align:middle line:84%
"What a game is he playing!"

00:30:10.556 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
"What a game is he playing!"

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.768 align:middle line:90%
"From the shell, a pearl,
and in the muck."

00:30:18.768 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
"The beautiful lotus is blossoming."

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:30.975 align:middle line:84%
"The beautiful lotus is blossoming."

00:30:30.975 --> 00:30:34.331 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:30:34.331 --> 00:30:39.465 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:30:39.465 --> 00:30:42.462 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:30:42.462 --> 00:30:48.382 align:middle line:90%
"Congratulations, Lawyer!
A son has born to you."

00:30:48.382 --> 00:30:55.504 align:middle line:90%
Son of a decent family!
Born in a filthy gutter!

00:30:55.504 --> 00:30:58.497 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:30:58.497 --> 00:31:02.423 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:31:02.423 --> 00:31:06.492 align:middle line:84%
"Lord, Your ways are strange."

00:31:06.492 --> 00:31:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you not know what your wife
and your son went through...

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.266 align:middle line:90%
after you shut your doors on them?
- No

00:31:12.266 --> 00:31:15.402 align:middle line:84%
Nor did you try to find out.

00:31:15.402 --> 00:31:18.499 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you.

00:31:18.499 --> 00:31:23.610 align:middle line:90%
To get out of your way,
your wife left Lucknow.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:29.539 align:middle line:90%
And your innocent son grew up
in a Bombay slum.

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:40.967 align:middle line:84%
One day...

00:31:40.967 --> 00:31:49.233 align:middle line:84%
Police! Scram!

00:31:49.233 --> 00:31:55.539 align:middle line:84%
Greetings, sir.

00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Hey Nathu...
- Hello, Constable.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.544 align:middle line:90%
What are you up there like a monkey?
Why don't you go to school?

00:32:02.544 --> 00:32:07.174 align:middle line:84%
At school, the master asks for fees.

00:32:07.174 --> 00:32:12.242 align:middle line:90%
My father hasn't the money
to send me to school.

00:32:12.242 --> 00:32:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Look at Leela's son, Raj.
He lives in this slum too.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:20.347 align:middle line:90%
His mother is worse off. Yet she
sends her boy to such a big school.

00:32:20.347 --> 00:32:26.980 align:middle line:90%
What did you say? He isn't a boy.
He's a sissy!

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:32.502 align:middle line:90%
Ma, why do you put oil in my hair?
- Oil keeps the hair soft.

00:32:32.502 --> 00:32:35.266 align:middle line:90%
But why do boys in the
neighbourhood call me sissy?

00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:39.193 align:middle line:90%
So what?
How do they compare with you?

00:32:39.193 --> 00:32:41.903 align:middle line:90%
You're a good boy
who goes to school.

00:32:41.903 --> 00:32:44.452 align:middle line:90%
You'll grow up to become
an educated man.

00:32:44.452 --> 00:32:48.905 align:middle line:84%
And those vagabonds will go to jail.

00:32:48.905 --> 00:32:52.886 align:middle line:84%
Mother, who are called vagabonds?

00:32:52.886 --> 00:32:55.131 align:middle line:84%
The ones who just tramp around.

00:32:55.131 --> 00:32:57.724 align:middle line:90%
Those who think that whatever
belongs to others, belongs to them.

00:32:57.724 --> 00:33:01.857 align:middle line:90%
Those who gamble and drink
instead of going to school.

00:33:01.857 --> 00:33:04.851 align:middle line:84%
And they have fun!

00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:07.558 align:middle line:90%
Ma, when I grow up,
I'll become vagabond too.

00:33:07.558 --> 00:33:14.827 align:middle line:84%
Nonsense! You'll become a lawyer.

00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:17.267 align:middle line:84%
Then a magistrate.

00:33:17.267 --> 00:33:18.843 align:middle line:84%
And then, a judge.

00:33:18.843 --> 00:33:21.264 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:33:21.264 --> 00:33:24.349 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:33:24.349 --> 00:33:28.964 align:middle line:90%
You're sitting here?
Everyone's out there buying chocolates.

00:33:28.964 --> 00:33:31.716 align:middle line:84%
I don't have money

00:33:31.716 --> 00:33:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Why, doesn't your mother
give you money?

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.754 align:middle line:84%
Daddy gives me a whole Rupee every day!

00:33:36.754 --> 00:33:39.173 align:middle line:84%
You're rich. And I'm poor.

00:33:39.173 --> 00:33:41.926 align:middle line:90%
Eat this
- No.

00:33:41.926 --> 00:33:43.993 align:middle line:90%
Ma says never ask
for anything to eat.

00:33:43.993 --> 00:33:50.613 align:middle line:90%
If she told you not to ask,
go ahead and snatch it.

00:33:50.613 --> 00:33:51.138 align:middle line:84%
Wild!

00:33:51.138 --> 00:33:54.725 align:middle line:90%
Wild?
- No, no, no.

00:33:54.725 --> 00:33:57.381 align:middle line:90%
You're coming to my place
this evening, aren't you?

00:33:57.381 --> 00:34:00.417 align:middle line:90%
Why, what's happening?
- My birthday party!

00:34:00.417 --> 00:34:02.193 align:middle line:84%
You must come! It's going to be fun!

00:34:02.193 --> 00:34:07.190 align:middle line:90%
You know, Daddy has ordered
such a huge cake!

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.687 align:middle line:84%
Happy birthday to you!

00:34:10.687 --> 00:34:20.565 align:middle line:84%
Happy birthday to you!

00:34:20.565 --> 00:34:22.198 align:middle line:84%
Happy birthday to you!

00:34:22.198 --> 00:34:24.448 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

00:34:24.448 --> 00:34:36.914 align:middle line:84%
Let's go and eat ice cream.

00:34:36.914 --> 00:34:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?

00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.443 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have money to buy anything.
I'll give you some other time.

00:34:45.443 --> 00:34:49.736 align:middle line:90%
Must you only buy something
to make a gift?

00:34:49.736 --> 00:35:00.686 align:middle line:90%
You can give me a flower.
- Really?

00:35:00.686 --> 00:35:03.732 align:middle line:84%
Here you are.

00:35:03.732 --> 00:35:07.101 align:middle line:90%
Someday, I'm going to make
lots of money.

00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:10.791 align:middle line:90%
And I'll buy a gift for you.
Something better than all this.

00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:12.753 align:middle line:84%
Do that.

00:35:12.753 --> 00:35:15.308 align:middle line:90%
But can anything be better
than this flower?

00:35:15.308 --> 00:35:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Ritu! Ritu! Your father
is calling you! - Coming!

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:28.851 align:middle line:84%
Come on Raj, meet my father.

00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:31.236 align:middle line:84%
You always say this.

00:35:31.236 --> 00:35:33.779 align:middle line:84%
Ritu, say hello to the Judge"

00:35:33.779 --> 00:35:36.263 align:middle line:84%
Hello, Judge.

00:35:36.263 --> 00:35:38.388 align:middle line:84%
Bless you.

00:35:38.388 --> 00:35:44.576 align:middle line:90%
You've grown up in these four years
You must've forgotten me.

00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:46.941 align:middle line:84%
Happy birthday

00:35:46.941 --> 00:35:53.309 align:middle line:90%
I've just arrived from Lucknow.
I owe you a present.

00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:58.777 align:middle line:84%
As of now, I can give you a flower.

00:35:58.777 --> 00:36:05.664 align:middle line:84%
Here you are.

00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:09.395 align:middle line:84%
Let me put it on your hair.

00:36:09.395 --> 00:36:12.681 align:middle line:90%
Someone has already put a flower
over there.

00:36:12.681 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Raj has given me this flower

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:18.427 align:middle line:90%
Daddy, this is Raj.
He's in my class.

00:36:18.427 --> 00:36:20.662 align:middle line:90%
I see.
- Hello.

00:36:20.662 --> 00:36:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Hello.
- Hello.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.503 align:middle line:84%
God bless you, son"

00:36:27.503 --> 00:36:31.924 align:middle line:90%
Raj says that he will become a judge
when he grows up.

00:36:31.924 --> 00:36:34.578 align:middle line:84%
Very good!

00:36:34.578 --> 00:36:38.656 align:middle line:84%
Your father must be a real gentleman.

00:36:38.656 --> 00:36:40.133 align:middle line:84%
What does your father do?

00:36:40.133 --> 00:36:45.665 align:middle line:90%
I don't have my father.
I have only my mother

00:36:45.665 --> 00:36:48.616 align:middle line:90%
Has he passed away?
- No! Don't say that!

00:36:48.616 --> 00:36:54.421 align:middle line:90%
My mother says he is alive.
But...

00:36:54.421 --> 00:36:59.736 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't live with you
...and you haven't seen him either?

00:36:59.736 --> 00:37:03.911 align:middle line:90%
Your father is a strange man.
- Not a word about my father.

00:37:03.911 --> 00:37:07.933 align:middle line:84%
Else... else...

00:37:07.933 --> 00:37:12.982 align:middle line:90%
Raj!
- Rita!

00:37:12.982 --> 00:37:17.910 align:middle line:90%
How can you let your daughter
play with boys like him?

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.273 align:middle line:84%
Go to play, Ritu"

00:37:20.273 --> 00:37:25.362 align:middle line:90%
Why, what's wrong with the boy?
I like him.

00:37:25.362 --> 00:37:30.268 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't even know his father's
name, and you like him?

00:37:30.268 --> 00:37:32.718 align:middle line:90%
I'd say he's just a wastrel
- Forget it.

00:37:32.718 --> 00:37:36.831 align:middle line:90%
Must you hang on to
those rotten old ideas?

00:37:36.831 --> 00:37:39.555 align:middle line:84%
What was the Bandit's name?

00:37:39.555 --> 00:37:41.305 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Jagga.

00:37:41.305 --> 00:37:45.333 align:middle line:90%
I remember you saying the same
at his trial.

00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:49.825 align:middle line:90%
That a bandit's son
always becomes a bandit.

00:37:49.825 --> 00:37:51.449 align:middle line:84%
I still stand by that principle.

00:37:51.449 --> 00:37:56.814 align:middle line:90%
Principles, principles and principles!
It's because of these blind dogmas...

00:37:56.814 --> 00:37:59.757 align:middle line:90%
that you lost someone
as precious as Leela.

00:37:59.757 --> 00:38:02.621 align:middle line:90%
And because of your principles,
you never married again.

00:38:02.621 --> 00:38:05.735 align:middle line:90%
The dry parched desert that
your life is, is your own doing.

00:38:05.735 --> 00:38:07.174 align:middle line:90%
So much so that you would rather
destroy a friendship...

00:38:07.174 --> 00:38:10.315 align:middle line:90%
between two innocent children?
Why, what has the poor child done...

00:38:10.315 --> 00:38:13.947 align:middle line:84%
to bring you to harm?

00:38:13.947 --> 00:38:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Not this boy. But it was...

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:22.539 align:middle line:90%
someone like him who destroyed my life
...and brought me to disgrace.

00:38:22.539 --> 00:38:25.438 align:middle line:90%
Maybe today, he too says
what this boy just said...

00:38:25.438 --> 00:38:31.454 align:middle line:90%
I'm only my mother's son
...I have no father.

00:38:31.454 --> 00:38:36.484 align:middle line:84%
In every urchin I see him...

00:38:36.484 --> 00:38:39.909 align:middle line:90%
the one whom my wife bore,
the one who isn't mine.

00:38:39.909 --> 00:38:45.323 align:middle line:84%
My wife's, yet not mine.

00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:47.782 align:middle line:90%
Rita looks good in that photo,
doesn't she?

00:38:47.782 --> 00:38:51.533 align:middle line:90%
But Ma, why do you work so hard?
This is why you fall ill.

00:38:51.533 --> 00:38:54.518 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to let you work
anymore, you understand?

00:38:54.518 --> 00:38:58.741 align:middle line:90%
You mad boy! If I don't work,
how are we going to eat?

00:38:58.741 --> 00:39:01.332 align:middle line:90%
I'm a man. I'm the one
who is going to work.

00:39:01.332 --> 00:39:03.566 align:middle line:84%
From tomorrow, no going to school!

00:39:03.566 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:90%
You won't go to school?
Won't you?

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.232 align:middle line:90%
How will you become a gentleman,
unless you educate yourself?

00:39:10.232 --> 00:39:14.825 align:middle line:90%
You want to be a vagabond!
- Mother!

00:39:14.825 --> 00:39:20.208 align:middle line:90%
Without schooling, how can you become
a lawyer, a magistrate, a judge?

00:39:20.208 --> 00:39:28.572 align:middle line:90%
If you say so, I'll go to school
...and I'll work too.

00:39:28.572 --> 00:39:33.454 align:middle line:90%
But I won't become a judge.
At Rita's I met a judge.

00:39:33.454 --> 00:39:57.588 align:middle line:84%
I didn't like him.

00:39:57.588 --> 00:40:05.772 align:middle line:90%
"Go for a stroll, those
who are going."

00:40:05.772 --> 00:40:10.577 align:middle line:90%
"Go for a stroll, those
who are going."

00:40:10.577 --> 00:40:13.929 align:middle line:84%
"Since when we have been waiting,

00:40:13.929 --> 00:40:19.111 align:middle line:84%
we cobblers."

00:40:19.111 --> 00:40:24.357 align:middle line:84%
Page 120.

00:40:24.357 --> 00:40:25.692 align:middle line:84%
Raj.

00:40:25.692 --> 00:40:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Good morning, teacher.
Sorry, I'm late.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.204 align:middle line:90%
I work, you know. I work
- What's all this?

00:40:32.204 --> 00:40:37.747 align:middle line:84%
Brush, wax... I give you a good polish.

00:40:37.747 --> 00:40:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Your name has been struck
from the rolls.

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.667 align:middle line:90%
What?
- You can't study here anymore.

00:40:43.667 --> 00:40:48.955 align:middle line:90%
But I've brought the fees too! If you
say so, I'll stop polishing boots.

00:40:48.955 --> 00:40:57.705 align:middle line:84%
Silence!

00:40:57.705 --> 00:41:00.781 align:middle line:84%
So I can't study here any longer, can I?

00:41:00.781 --> 00:41:02.972 align:middle line:84%
No.

00:41:02.972 --> 00:41:09.491 align:middle line:90%
For a minute, can I talk to Rita?
I have a gift for her.

00:41:09.491 --> 00:41:25.644 align:middle line:90%
Rita's father has transferred her
out of this school. They have moved.

00:41:25.644 --> 00:41:28.555 align:middle line:84%
Why did you kick my ball?

00:41:28.555 --> 00:41:30.969 align:middle line:84%
Forgive me, I stepped on it by mistake.

00:41:30.969 --> 00:41:36.621 align:middle line:90%
How dare a boot-polish-boy?
- Hit him!

00:41:36.621 --> 00:41:38.508 align:middle line:84%
Beat him! Beat him!

00:41:38.508 --> 00:41:41.633 align:middle line:90%
You're just a boot-polish boy.
You dare take me on?

00:41:41.633 --> 00:41:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Beat him! Beat him!

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.292 align:middle line:84%
Hit him!

00:41:46.292 --> 00:41:52.215 align:middle line:84%
His coat... strip him!

00:41:52.215 --> 00:41:54.729 align:middle line:84%
Hit him!

00:41:54.729 --> 00:41:59.715 align:middle line:84%
Beat him! Beat him!

00:41:59.715 --> 00:42:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Beat him! Beat him!

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:05.819 align:middle line:84%
Beat him! Beat him!

00:42:05.819 --> 00:42:08.632 align:middle line:90%
My Ma is ill.
Let me go to my Ma.

00:42:08.632 --> 00:42:12.689 align:middle line:90%
You can hit me some other time.
My Ma is ill. Let me go to my Ma.

00:42:12.689 --> 00:42:14.689 align:middle line:90%
Your Ma is ill?
- Yes

00:42:14.689 --> 00:42:19.361 align:middle line:84%
His Ma is ill!

00:42:19.361 --> 00:42:22.234 align:middle line:84%
Run! Uncle Jagga is here! Run!

00:42:22.234 --> 00:42:46.823 align:middle line:84%
Run! Uncle Jagga is here! Run!

00:42:46.823 --> 00:42:54.769 align:middle line:84%
Get up. Come with me.

00:42:54.769 --> 00:42:57.353 align:middle line:90%
Where to?
- Wherever I go.

00:42:57.353 --> 00:43:00.890 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you go wherever I go.

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:04.342 align:middle line:84%
That's what your father wanted.

00:43:04.342 --> 00:43:07.365 align:middle line:90%
You know my father?
- Yes.

00:43:07.365 --> 00:43:13.245 align:middle line:84%
I knew him.

00:43:13.245 --> 00:43:18.229 align:middle line:90%
Whatever I am today,
is all thanks to him.

00:43:18.229 --> 00:43:21.386 align:middle line:84%
I owe your Dad an old debt.

00:43:21.386 --> 00:43:23.612 align:middle line:90%
Then you'll surely help me
find a job somewhere?

00:43:23.612 --> 00:43:27.329 align:middle line:90%
Job? What job?
- Whatever! I'll do anything!

00:43:27.329 --> 00:43:31.266 align:middle line:90%
My Ma is sick! We haven't anything
to eat! Give me any job!

00:43:31.266 --> 00:43:34.354 align:middle line:90%
I'll clean the dishes, sweep floors,
carry luggage... I'll do anything!

00:43:34.354 --> 00:43:38.857 align:middle line:84%
Just give me a job! Give me a job!

00:43:38.857 --> 00:43:41.901 align:middle line:84%
You fool! Only fools work.

00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:44.980 align:middle line:90%
You're a smart boy.
And you talk of working?

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.708 align:middle line:90%
Unless I work, how will I eat?
How will I feed my mother?

00:43:48.708 --> 00:44:01.664 align:middle line:90%
Steal
- Steal?

00:44:01.664 --> 00:44:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Stealing... no!

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:18.533 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes!
Steal! Steal! Steal!

00:44:18.533 --> 00:44:34.174 align:middle line:84%
Pick pockets, locks, rob, kill.

00:44:34.174 --> 00:44:39.826 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:44:39.826 --> 00:44:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:46.304 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:44:46.304 --> 00:44:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:51.258 align:middle line:84%
You took so long, son.

00:44:51.258 --> 00:44:55.298 align:middle line:90%
You've been hungry all day.
Go on, eat food.

00:44:55.298 --> 00:45:00.314 align:middle line:90%
Food? Have you cooked?
- Yes, why not?

00:45:00.314 --> 00:45:03.541 align:middle line:84%
It's over there, under the plate.

00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:06.910 align:middle line:90%
The bread is warm.
I even cooked potatoes.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:20.258 align:middle line:84%
Take some. It's on the shelf.

00:45:20.258 --> 00:45:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Have you found it?

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Yes Ma, I found it.

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:37.589 align:middle line:84%
The bread, and potatoes too.

00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:41.492 align:middle line:84%
The potatoes are delicious.

00:45:41.492 --> 00:45:48.896 align:middle line:90%
Eat it then. Give me a bread too.
I'm very hungry.

00:45:48.896 --> 00:45:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Very hungry.
- Bread?

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:57.324 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Ma. I'll get it right now.

00:45:57.324 --> 00:46:04.642 align:middle line:84%
Right now.

00:46:04.642 --> 00:46:07.745 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes!
Steal! Steal! Steal!

00:46:07.745 --> 00:46:31.912 align:middle line:84%
Pick pockets, locks, rob, kill.

00:46:31.912 --> 00:46:33.703 align:middle line:84%
You thief!

00:46:33.703 --> 00:46:37.236 align:middle line:90%
Stealing bread?
- Excuse me, my Ma is hungry.

00:46:37.236 --> 00:46:39.546 align:middle line:90%
She hasn't had anything to eat
in three days

00:46:39.546 --> 00:46:47.853 align:middle line:84%
Son of a gun! Off you go to the cops!

00:46:47.853 --> 00:46:51.764 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?
I asked you what's your name?

00:46:51.764 --> 00:46:52.983 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

00:46:52.983 --> 00:46:54.883 align:middle line:84%
Father's name?

00:46:54.883 --> 00:46:57.518 align:middle line:90%
Ma has never told me
my father's name.

00:46:57.518 --> 00:47:01.603 align:middle line:90%
Where does your mother live?
I asked you where your mother lives.

00:47:01.603 --> 00:47:04.247 align:middle line:84%
I won't tell you. I won't.

00:47:04.247 --> 00:47:07.967 align:middle line:90%
If you don't, who pays for your bail?
You'll go to jail. You know that?

00:47:07.967 --> 00:47:16.604 align:middle line:84%
Jail!

00:47:16.604 --> 00:47:18.651 align:middle line:90%
Where are you running?
- Don't send me to jail!

00:47:18.651 --> 00:47:20.911 align:middle line:90%
My Ma is hungry.
Don't send me to jail!

00:47:20.911 --> 00:47:27.560 align:middle line:90%
My Ma is hungry.
Don't send me to jail!

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:33.747 align:middle line:90%
Afraid, son? Don't be.
This is just your first step.

00:47:33.747 --> 00:48:25.227 align:middle line:84%
The road ahead is very long.

00:48:25.227 --> 00:48:28.164 align:middle line:84%
Hey, are you mad?

00:48:28.164 --> 00:48:31.667 align:middle line:84%
Why are you laughing at your bread?

00:48:31.667 --> 00:48:35.677 align:middle line:84%
This bread...

00:48:35.677 --> 00:48:38.917 align:middle line:90%
you know this bread?
She makes you dance.

00:48:38.917 --> 00:48:42.445 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?
- She made me dance!

00:48:42.445 --> 00:48:47.496 align:middle line:90%
Outside the jail twelve years ago,
had I found her...

00:48:47.496 --> 00:48:50.646 align:middle line:90%
would I be here time and again,
for her sake?

00:48:50.646 --> 00:48:55.277 align:middle line:90%
You've had enough for free.
Come on, the jailer is calling you.

00:48:55.277 --> 00:48:58.407 align:middle line:90%
Your time's up. Find yourself
some other hotel.

00:48:58.407 --> 00:48:59.512 align:middle line:90%
Time is over?
- Yes.

00:48:59.512 --> 00:49:02.245 align:middle line:90%
Okay, boss! I don't like
the food of this place!

00:49:02.245 --> 00:49:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I will eat in Taj Mahal Hotel.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:07.534 align:middle line:90%
If you want to eat at
the Taj Mahal Hotel, stop thieving.

00:49:07.534 --> 00:49:10.579 align:middle line:90%
Yes, boss.
- Stop picking pockets.

00:49:10.579 --> 00:49:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes, boss.
- And do some honest work.

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:36.576 align:middle line:84%
Sure. I'm going on a pilgrimage.

00:49:36.576 --> 00:49:42.248 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

00:49:42.248 --> 00:49:48.185 align:middle line:90%
"In troubled times, I am
the star in the sky."

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:53.804 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

00:49:53.804 --> 00:49:59.688 align:middle line:90%
"In troubled times,
I am the star in the sky."

00:49:59.688 --> 00:50:16.573 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond."

00:50:16.573 --> 00:50:19.605 align:middle line:84%
"I don't have a house or a family."

00:50:19.605 --> 00:50:27.710 align:middle line:84%
"Nobody loves me. Nobody loves me."

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:31.889 align:middle line:90%
"There is no promise of meeting
someone from across."

00:50:31.889 --> 00:50:37.518 align:middle line:84%
"Nobody loves me. Nobody loves me."

00:50:37.518 --> 00:50:43.173 align:middle line:90%
"I'm the beloved of isolated
and alien places."

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:48.684 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

00:50:48.684 --> 00:50:54.978 align:middle line:90%
"In troubled times, I am
the star in the sky."

00:50:54.978 --> 00:51:13.953 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond."

00:51:13.953 --> 00:51:15.562 align:middle line:90%
"I'm not flourishing,
I am not ruined."

00:51:15.562 --> 00:51:18.379 align:middle line:84%
"Still I sing happy songs."

00:51:18.379 --> 00:51:22.512 align:middle line:84%
"Still I sing happy songs."

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:25.402 align:middle line:84%
"My heart is filled with wounds."

00:51:25.402 --> 00:51:31.273 align:middle line:84%
"But still these lively eyes smile."

00:51:31.273 --> 00:51:36.964 align:middle line:84%
"World.."

00:51:36.964 --> 00:51:46.840 align:middle line:90%
"World, I am troubled by your
sorrows or misfortunes."

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:52.271 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

00:51:52.271 --> 00:51:57.874 align:middle line:90%
"In troubled times, I am
the star in the sky."

00:51:57.874 --> 00:52:03.250 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond. I am a vagabond."

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:32.122 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond."

00:52:32.122 --> 00:52:36.837 align:middle line:84%
Hands up!

00:52:36.837 --> 00:52:41.466 align:middle line:84%
Raj! Raj!

00:52:41.466 --> 00:52:45.232 align:middle line:84%
Raj! You had me scared.

00:52:45.232 --> 00:52:50.274 align:middle line:84%
Come on, give me a hug.

00:52:50.274 --> 00:52:53.848 align:middle line:84%
Well boss, how is business?

00:52:53.848 --> 00:52:57.624 align:middle line:90%
Hey, are you talking English?
- This time in jail...

00:52:57.624 --> 00:53:02.492 align:middle line:90%
I came across one of the politicos.
I thought I'd make the most of it.

00:53:02.492 --> 00:53:03.593 align:middle line:84%
I could use it.

00:53:03.593 --> 00:53:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, what news of Ma?
You told her, didn't you?

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:11.527 align:middle line:90%
Yes, a long time ago. She thinks
you're away on a long business trip...

00:53:11.527 --> 00:53:18.630 align:middle line:90%
with your boss. When you go home,
you must go home in style.

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:22.247 align:middle line:90%
I have it all fixed.
- First, tell me...

00:53:22.247 --> 00:53:28.423 align:middle line:90%
have you been sending money to Ma?
- Of course! On the 1st of every month!

00:53:28.423 --> 00:53:35.742 align:middle line:90%
Say, you'd need some money,
wouldn't you? Keep this.

00:53:35.742 --> 00:53:37.402 align:middle line:84%
Looking for this thing?

00:53:37.402 --> 00:53:40.581 align:middle line:90%
I guessed it was for me.
So why not take it for myself?

00:53:40.581 --> 00:53:43.449 align:middle line:84%
Want a ten or a twenty? No?

00:53:43.449 --> 00:53:56.375 align:middle line:90%
Bravo, my boy! You'll make
your guru proud someday.

00:53:56.375 --> 00:54:04.363 align:middle line:90%
And someday, I'll ask your father what
the gentleman's son grows up to be.

00:54:04.363 --> 00:54:08.821 align:middle line:84%
Mother!

00:54:08.821 --> 00:54:15.195 align:middle line:90%
Hello, mummy darling! Hello!
- Raj! Raj!

00:54:15.195 --> 00:54:22.732 align:middle line:90%
Raj, I've been dying to see you!
This time, it has been a whole year!

00:54:22.732 --> 00:54:25.866 align:middle line:90%
Where has this boss of yours
been taking you to?

00:54:25.866 --> 00:54:28.452 align:middle line:90%
This time, I've been
to London and more.

00:54:28.452 --> 00:54:32.349 align:middle line:84%
London?

00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:35.950 align:middle line:90%
London, France, Paris,
New York, America.

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:38.869 align:middle line:90%
On my way back, I even stopped
at Arthur Road.

00:54:38.869 --> 00:54:44.865 align:middle line:90%
My boss is into import and export.
- What's that?

00:54:44.865 --> 00:54:49.720 align:middle line:90%
You don't know import-export?
You're so naive.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.978 align:middle line:90%
Your son is about to become a big
businessman, and you don't know...

00:54:52.978 --> 00:54:58.218 align:middle line:90%
what import-export is?
Listen to this, Ma.

00:54:58.218 --> 00:55:05.134 align:middle line:90%
Import-export means moving the money
between here and there.

00:55:05.134 --> 00:55:10.572 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, it comes in this way.

00:55:10.572 --> 00:55:13.977 align:middle line:90%
How would I know?
You've even started talking English.

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:45.215 align:middle line:84%
Sit, I'll get tea for you.

00:55:45.215 --> 00:55:48.271 align:middle line:84%
What are you looking at?

00:55:48.271 --> 00:55:50.879 align:middle line:84%
I'm a thief.

00:55:50.879 --> 00:55:54.603 align:middle line:84%
A lying thief.

00:55:54.603 --> 00:56:02.765 align:middle line:84%
I've sinned.

00:56:02.765 --> 00:56:08.877 align:middle line:84%
Why did you turn that photo over?

00:56:08.877 --> 00:56:15.252 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I look at it...

00:56:15.252 --> 00:56:17.294 align:middle line:84%
she seems to be staring at me.

00:56:17.294 --> 00:56:21.608 align:middle line:90%
She brings back childhood memories.
Why don't you admit that?

00:56:21.608 --> 00:56:29.829 align:middle line:90%
Where could she be now?
Why don't you try to locate her?

00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:35.214 align:middle line:90%
Childhood days, and childhood friends
...do they ever come back, Ma?

00:56:35.214 --> 00:56:37.334 align:middle line:90%
I'm going out.
- But your tea?

00:56:37.334 --> 00:56:40.498 align:middle line:84%
Forget it. I've got to see a friend.

00:56:40.498 --> 00:57:19.877 align:middle line:84%
My son he is! Silly boy!

00:57:19.877 --> 00:57:23.314 align:middle line:90%
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

00:57:23.314 --> 00:57:27.341 align:middle line:90%
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

00:57:27.341 --> 00:57:31.264 align:middle line:90%
"Meeting covertly at night is
considered as sin by others."

00:57:31.264 --> 00:57:32.197 align:middle line:84%
"Sin."

00:57:32.197 --> 00:57:36.577 align:middle line:90%
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

00:57:36.577 --> 00:58:02.610 align:middle line:90%
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:10.336 align:middle line:84%
"This is salacious youth."

00:58:10.336 --> 00:58:14.181 align:middle line:84%
"This is salacious youth."

00:58:14.181 --> 00:58:29.498 align:middle line:84%
"It is crazy for you."

00:58:29.498 --> 00:58:32.843 align:middle line:90%
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

00:58:32.843 --> 00:58:57.801 align:middle line:90%
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

00:58:57.801 --> 00:59:05.435 align:middle line:84%
"Why do you reject me?"

00:59:05.435 --> 00:59:09.252 align:middle line:84%
"Why do you reject me?"

00:59:09.252 --> 00:59:13.124 align:middle line:84%
"Why don't you look in my eyes?"

00:59:13.124 --> 00:59:16.989 align:middle line:84%
"Rob, the world is yours."

00:59:16.989 --> 00:59:20.789 align:middle line:84%
"Rob, the world is yours."

00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:24.615 align:middle line:84%
"Why are you afraid of love?"

00:59:24.615 --> 00:59:27.930 align:middle line:90%
"1, 2, 3. Come, the
weather is lovely."

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:53.752 align:middle line:90%
"Come. 1, 2, 3. Come,
the weather is lovely."

00:59:53.752 --> 00:59:59.211 align:middle line:90%
How much did you make today?
- Ten thousand five hundred.

00:59:59.211 --> 01:00:05.834 align:middle line:84%
Fifty-Fifty.

01:00:05.834 --> 01:00:10.129 align:middle line:90%
Why only fifty-fifty?
You can have many times more.

01:00:10.129 --> 01:00:12.385 align:middle line:90%
How?
- Tomorrow morning...

01:00:12.385 --> 01:00:16.394 align:middle line:90%
a bank is being inaugurated.
Say, how's the opportunity?

01:00:16.394 --> 01:00:19.862 align:middle line:90%
A sleight of hand, and there's
a hundred thousand or so going.

01:00:19.862 --> 01:00:21.685 align:middle line:90%
All you need is a car.
- Car?

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:25.954 align:middle line:90%
A good car.
- For me, that's a sleight of hand.

01:00:25.954 --> 01:00:29.619 align:middle line:90%
Eleven tomorrow. - Where?
- I'll tell you where.

01:00:29.619 --> 01:00:31.572 align:middle line:84%
Okay, boss.

01:00:31.572 --> 01:00:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Good! Someday,
you'll surely make me proud.

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:51.309 align:middle line:84%
It's late.

01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:54.344 align:middle line:84%
You have to make it by eleven.

01:00:54.344 --> 01:00:56.984 align:middle line:84%
First class car!

01:00:56.984 --> 01:01:00.926 align:middle line:90%
Car? Where?
- Out there

01:01:00.926 --> 01:01:02.842 align:middle line:90%
Who's driving it?
- No idea.

01:01:02.842 --> 01:01:05.477 align:middle line:90%
A girl just got down
and walked into that shop.

01:01:05.477 --> 01:01:10.964 align:middle line:90%
Keys?
- With her, maybe.

01:01:10.964 --> 01:01:27.979 align:middle line:90%
That one?
- Yes.

01:01:27.979 --> 01:01:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Idiot! Can't you see?

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:41.171 align:middle line:84%
Found it?

01:01:41.171 --> 01:01:44.323 align:middle line:90%
No keys here.
- Then?

01:01:44.323 --> 01:01:46.421 align:middle line:90%
Return the bag.
- What for?

01:01:46.421 --> 01:01:49.906 align:middle line:90%
It will make things easier.
We'll make it work.

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:55.750 align:middle line:84%
How will you return it?

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.948 align:middle line:90%
What happened?
- I've been robbed!

01:01:57.948 --> 01:01:59.643 align:middle line:90%
Who did it?
- I didn't notice.

01:01:59.643 --> 01:02:01.990 align:middle line:84%
He was with you!

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:06.211 align:middle line:90%
I had it a moment ago
- You didn't notice who robbed you?

01:02:06.211 --> 01:02:09.725 align:middle line:84%
Had I noticed, I would've caught him!

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
You...

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.799 align:middle line:90%
Yes you!
- Who me?

01:02:13.799 --> 01:02:28.544 align:middle line:90%
Look, there goes the thief!
Stop! Thief!

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.606 align:middle line:84%
He jumped over the wall!

01:02:30.606 --> 01:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Wait here

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:44.407 align:middle line:84%
Come on, help me.

01:02:44.407 --> 01:02:54.979 align:middle line:84%
There you are! Hiding!

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:57.329 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you ashamed? Give it to me.
Else, I'll beat you to pulp.

01:02:57.329 --> 01:03:00.149 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to kill you! Give me!

01:03:00.149 --> 01:03:08.866 align:middle line:84%
Where are you running away?

01:03:08.866 --> 01:03:13.999 align:middle line:84%
Give the purse!

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:18.536 align:middle line:84%
You dare stare at me like that?

01:03:18.536 --> 01:03:33.872 align:middle line:84%
Hey... knife!

01:03:33.872 --> 01:03:37.245 align:middle line:84%
Are you running away? Coward!

01:03:37.245 --> 01:03:39.487 align:middle line:84%
Coward!

01:03:39.487 --> 01:03:46.594 align:middle line:84%
Scoundrel!

01:03:46.594 --> 01:03:49.777 align:middle line:84%
He ran away

01:03:49.777 --> 01:03:52.624 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, here's your purse"

01:03:52.624 --> 01:03:54.686 align:middle line:84%
Keep it.

01:03:54.686 --> 01:04:00.634 align:middle line:90%
You've been through so much
trouble for my sake.

01:04:00.634 --> 01:04:05.717 align:middle line:84%
No trouble. I've taken more.

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:12.197 align:middle line:90%
I should apologise. You risked
your life to get my purse back.

01:04:12.197 --> 01:04:17.448 align:middle line:90%
And I suspected you.
- Not your fault.

01:04:17.448 --> 01:04:19.352 align:middle line:84%
It's just my looks.

01:04:19.352 --> 01:04:22.448 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes even the police
are mistaken.

01:04:22.448 --> 01:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Bye

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.845 align:middle line:90%
How was the show?
- No use.

01:04:29.845 --> 01:04:33.338 align:middle line:90%
We'll find a car. Why worry?
Get over to the place.

01:04:33.338 --> 01:04:37.286 align:middle line:90%
I'll join you after a change
of clothes.

01:04:37.286 --> 01:04:40.442 align:middle line:90%
Hey Romeo! You tear your clothes
no sooner than you see a girl!

01:04:40.442 --> 01:05:04.663 align:middle line:90%
Get lost.
- Get going.

01:05:04.663 --> 01:06:01.699 align:middle line:84%
Stop! Thief!

01:06:01.699 --> 01:06:05.602 align:middle line:84%
Where are you going?

01:06:05.602 --> 01:06:07.982 align:middle line:84%
Inside.

01:06:07.982 --> 01:06:12.692 align:middle line:90%
Inside? What do you want?
- Strange question.

01:06:12.692 --> 01:06:15.283 align:middle line:90%
Your boss is the one who called me.
And you ask me what I want?

01:06:15.283 --> 01:06:18.149 align:middle line:84%
The boss, or the lady? Who called you?

01:06:18.149 --> 01:06:19.719 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the lady.

01:06:19.719 --> 01:06:23.173 align:middle line:90%
So you're the one
who fixes the piano?

01:06:23.173 --> 01:06:27.309 align:middle line:84%
Yes! The piano fixer!

01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:28.802 align:middle line:90%
Is the piano in there?
- Are pianos kept outside?

01:06:28.802 --> 01:06:56.148 align:middle line:90%
No! Inside. Come on in,
else I'll get into trouble.

01:06:56.148 --> 01:07:06.981 align:middle line:84%
Looks like a billionaire's palace!

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:17.398 align:middle line:90%
Hello, darling.
- What did you say?

01:07:17.398 --> 01:07:20.646 align:middle line:84%
The mantle!

01:07:20.646 --> 01:07:24.486 align:middle line:84%
What a lovely mantle!

01:07:24.486 --> 01:07:30.912 align:middle line:84%
What a grand mansion!

01:07:30.912 --> 01:07:33.725 align:middle line:84%
The mantle!

01:07:33.725 --> 01:07:39.909 align:middle line:90%
What kind of a joke is this?
Here's the piano.

01:07:39.909 --> 01:07:43.556 align:middle line:90%
This piano is in bad shape.
Badly damaged.

01:07:43.556 --> 01:07:45.417 align:middle line:84%
Look.

01:07:45.417 --> 01:07:50.986 align:middle line:90%
Rotten! It'll take me time to fix it.
Go on, get back to work.

01:07:50.986 --> 01:08:15.839 align:middle line:84%
I'll fix it.

01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:21.692 align:middle line:84%
Who's playing my piano?

01:08:21.692 --> 01:08:33.549 align:middle line:90%
You?
- You!

01:08:33.549 --> 01:08:39.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm mistaken, once again
I thought it must be a thief.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.908 align:middle line:90%
That's what I am.
- What?

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:44.637 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who else but a thief
would come in uninvited?

01:08:44.637 --> 01:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
No, it's good of you to have come.

01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:52.343 align:middle line:90%
You did me a favour.
I should've called you over.

01:08:52.343 --> 01:08:57.575 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know your address.
How did you find out my address?

01:08:57.575 --> 01:09:02.725 align:middle line:90%
What?
- How did you find out my address?

01:09:02.725 --> 01:09:05.986 align:middle line:90%
No, don't ask me that.
It's a secret.

01:09:05.986 --> 01:09:08.948 align:middle line:90%
Let's say, it's luck that has led me
to your doorstep.

01:09:08.948 --> 01:09:25.514 align:middle line:90%
Please be seated
- Thanks.

01:09:25.514 --> 01:09:28.543 align:middle line:84%
Cigarette?

01:09:28.543 --> 01:09:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Lighter?

01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:34.447 align:middle line:84%
No, thanks. Matches.

01:09:34.447 --> 01:09:37.349 align:middle line:90%
Madam, he's the piano-fixer...
- Piano fixer?

01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:39.912 align:middle line:90%
Your servant thinks I'm here
to fix the piano.

01:09:39.912 --> 01:09:47.666 align:middle line:90%
But you said...
- Never mind, take the call. Go on.

01:09:47.666 --> 01:09:51.946 align:middle line:90%
Strange fellow.
He took you for a piano mechanic.

01:09:51.946 --> 01:09:56.689 align:middle line:90%
Not his fault.
It's just my looks.

01:09:56.689 --> 01:09:58.873 align:middle line:84%
Inspector sahib, no thief came in here.

01:09:58.873 --> 01:10:00.679 align:middle line:84%
Please wait here.

01:10:00.679 --> 01:10:03.334 align:middle line:84%
Inspector?

01:10:03.334 --> 01:10:08.542 align:middle line:90%
What brings the police here?
Excuse me, I'll be back.

01:10:08.542 --> 01:10:15.338 align:middle line:90%
A car thief has sneaked into one
of the houses in this neighbourhood.

01:10:15.338 --> 01:10:20.796 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen anyone?
- No, no one came in here.

01:10:20.796 --> 01:10:25.713 align:middle line:90%
She's wrong about
no one coming in here.

01:10:25.713 --> 01:10:28.945 align:middle line:90%
I happen to be a visitor.
Would you be looking for me?

01:10:28.945 --> 01:10:31.513 align:middle line:84%
No... how could this be?

01:10:31.513 --> 01:10:36.417 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Forgive me.

01:10:36.417 --> 01:10:39.833 align:middle line:84%
Come.

01:10:39.833 --> 01:10:43.391 align:middle line:90%
Grand house.
- Yes. It belongs to the Judge.

01:10:43.391 --> 01:10:46.723 align:middle line:90%
Judge?
- Yes, he's my guardian.

01:10:46.723 --> 01:10:48.487 align:middle line:84%
Guardian?

01:10:48.487 --> 01:10:52.381 align:middle line:90%
Like the guard on the train
...signalling red and green?

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:56.271 align:middle line:90%
No. After my father passed away,
I have been his ward.

01:10:56.271 --> 01:10:59.304 align:middle line:90%
For the sake of my education,
he left Lucknow and he came to Bombay.

01:10:59.304 --> 01:11:02.871 align:middle line:84%
I am much obliged to him.

01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:07.623 align:middle line:90%
Do judges sport such grand houses?
He must be making a pile on the side.

01:11:07.623 --> 01:11:10.928 align:middle line:90%
What a thing to say!
The judge is very principled.

01:11:10.928 --> 01:11:17.687 align:middle line:90%
He never spares criminals.
- I hope God spares him!

01:11:17.687 --> 01:11:23.902 align:middle line:90%
Not to worry. If you're ever arraigned
in his court, let me defend your case.

01:11:23.902 --> 01:11:30.162 align:middle line:90%
You... lawyer?
- Yes.

01:11:30.162 --> 01:11:34.521 align:middle line:84%
I took you for a schoolgirl.

01:11:34.521 --> 01:11:37.736 align:middle line:90%
That was a nice one. A couple
of months, and I'll be an advocate.

01:11:37.736 --> 01:11:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to see my degree?

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:47.351 align:middle line:90%
A judge lives here. And a lawyer too.
Leaves only one to make a full court!

01:11:47.351 --> 01:11:50.529 align:middle line:90%
Yours truly. And here I am.
- And what are you up to?

01:11:50.529 --> 01:11:52.978 align:middle line:84%
I steal.

01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:55.555 align:middle line:90%
Stealing, picking pockets, locks,
ladies' purses, like yours...

01:11:55.555 --> 01:11:58.787 align:middle line:90%
that's what I'm up to.
- You're joking again. Be seated.

01:11:58.787 --> 01:12:03.561 align:middle line:90%
You don't think I'm a thief?
- No, I think you're a gentleman.

01:12:03.561 --> 01:12:07.303 align:middle line:84%
This is the new world order!

01:12:07.303 --> 01:12:10.961 align:middle line:90%
The thieves, the hoodwinkers, they
all dress in first class suits like...

01:12:10.961 --> 01:12:14.392 align:middle line:90%
...I'm wearing and
we take them for gentlemen.

01:12:14.392 --> 01:12:19.426 align:middle line:90%
But those who work hard for an
honest living and dress shabbily...

01:12:19.426 --> 01:12:25.226 align:middle line:90%
...are labelled tramps and wastrels.
The capitalists, the blackmarketeers...

01:12:25.226 --> 01:12:30.855 align:middle line:90%
the profiteers, the usurers...
who are they? Thieves, like I am!

01:12:30.855 --> 01:12:36.132 align:middle line:90%
You sound like a stock broker
or a banker.

01:12:36.132 --> 01:12:37.759 align:middle line:90%
You might say that give and take
of money is what I'm concerned with.

01:12:37.759 --> 01:12:41.235 align:middle line:90%
As far as banks are concerned,
I visit banks regularly.

01:12:41.235 --> 01:12:44.801 align:middle line:84%
Be seated.

01:12:44.801 --> 01:13:02.487 align:middle line:84%
Tell me your name.

01:13:02.487 --> 01:13:13.141 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, whose photo is this?
- Mine.

01:13:13.141 --> 01:13:17.498 align:middle line:90%
You?
- Yes, when I was young.

01:13:17.498 --> 01:13:20.675 align:middle line:84%
It's a birthday photo.

01:13:20.675 --> 01:13:31.733 align:middle line:90%
Your name?
- Rita. Why?

01:13:31.733 --> 01:13:37.109 align:middle line:90%
Ms Rita, would you like to come
to my house?

01:13:37.109 --> 01:13:41.151 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to show you
something unique.

01:13:41.151 --> 01:13:56.126 align:middle line:90%
My mother would be very pleased
to meet you. Come

01:13:56.126 --> 01:13:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

01:13:58.810 --> 01:14:00.593 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:14:00.593 --> 01:14:11.837 align:middle line:90%
You?
- After twelve years.

01:14:11.837 --> 01:14:15.169 align:middle line:84%
You've changed!

01:14:15.169 --> 01:14:21.293 align:middle line:84%
You haven't changed at all.

01:14:21.293 --> 01:14:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Where have you been, Raj?

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.489 align:middle line:84%
Looking for you.

01:14:28.489 --> 01:14:32.161 align:middle line:90%
And at last, I've found you
- And when I saw you...

01:14:32.161 --> 01:14:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I took you for a thief.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.859 align:middle line:90%
Not your fault.
It's in my looks.

01:14:40.859 --> 01:15:28.893 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

01:15:28.893 --> 01:15:35.670 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:53.245 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:15:53.245 --> 01:15:57.676 align:middle line:84%
"The heart had spoken to a heart."

01:15:57.676 --> 01:16:02.347 align:middle line:84%
"The heart had spoken to a heart."

01:16:02.347 --> 01:16:06.716 align:middle line:84%
"The old times have come back."

01:16:06.716 --> 01:16:10.853 align:middle line:84%
"The old times have come back."

01:16:10.853 --> 01:16:17.395 align:middle line:90%
"He brought the happiness with
him, my heart flutters."

01:16:17.395 --> 01:16:34.403 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:16:34.403 --> 01:16:38.840 align:middle line:90%
"From the eyes, he dwelled
in my heart."

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:43.158 align:middle line:90%
"From the eyes, he dwelled
in my heart."

01:16:43.158 --> 01:16:47.151 align:middle line:84%
"I smile and scatter the stars."

01:16:47.151 --> 01:16:51.822 align:middle line:84%
"I smile and scatter the stars."

01:16:51.822 --> 01:16:58.762 align:middle line:90%
"Feelings dance and sing,
my heart flutters."

01:16:58.762 --> 01:17:16.601 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:17:16.601 --> 01:17:19.947 align:middle line:90%
"The days belong to us
and love is young."

01:17:19.947 --> 01:17:24.441 align:middle line:90%
"The days belong to us
and love is young."

01:17:24.441 --> 01:17:28.387 align:middle line:90%
"My world is flourishing
due to him."

01:17:28.387 --> 01:17:33.562 align:middle line:90%
"My world is flourishing
due to him."

01:17:33.562 --> 01:17:39.387 align:middle line:90%
"The thief returned to my heart,
my heart flutters."

01:17:39.387 --> 01:17:46.320 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:53.560 align:middle line:90%
"Since my beloved came home,
my heart flutters."

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:58.779 align:middle line:84%
The Judge is here.

01:17:58.779 --> 01:18:00.764 align:middle line:84%
So here you are. And you're late.

01:18:00.764 --> 01:18:06.663 align:middle line:90%
The doctor has told you to come home
and rest for at least an hour.

01:18:06.663 --> 01:18:09.618 align:middle line:90%
But you won't listen.
You look so tired.

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:11.504 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Rita.
- Hello, Rita!

01:18:11.504 --> 01:18:16.708 align:middle line:90%
Just sit here. I'll get you
your dressing gown.

01:18:16.708 --> 01:18:19.444 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, where have you been
all this time?

01:18:19.444 --> 01:18:24.737 align:middle line:90%
I had a lecture in the law college.
I went there directly from the court.

01:18:24.737 --> 01:18:29.324 align:middle line:90%
All that jabbering
is giving me a headache.

01:18:29.324 --> 01:18:34.643 align:middle line:90%
That's bound to happen. The doctor
told you to eat before eight.

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:39.548 align:middle line:84%
It's nine thirty now.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:45.443 align:middle line:90%
Listen to that!
Even the clock is angry with you.

01:18:45.443 --> 01:19:06.666 align:middle line:84%
Come on.

01:19:06.666 --> 01:19:11.819 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about yourself. What have
you been up to all evening?

01:19:11.819 --> 01:19:18.742 align:middle line:90%
You look as if you've found
a treasure.

01:19:18.742 --> 01:19:23.234 align:middle line:90%
You could say that. A long-lost friend
is no less than a treasure.

01:19:23.234 --> 01:19:34.693 align:middle line:90%
You'll be glad when you meet Raj.
You're certain to like him!

01:19:34.693 --> 01:19:42.876 align:middle line:90%
Who is this Mr. Raj? Where does he live?
What does he do? What's his family name?

01:19:42.876 --> 01:19:47.172 align:middle line:90%
He's a childhood friend.
We were in school together.

01:19:47.172 --> 01:19:50.107 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing him after twelve years!

01:19:50.107 --> 01:19:53.951 align:middle line:84%
After twelve years?

01:19:53.951 --> 01:19:56.702 align:middle line:90%
After so many years,
most people change.

01:19:56.702 --> 01:20:00.635 align:middle line:90%
Raj has changed too. At school,
he used to be very quiet.

01:20:00.635 --> 01:20:04.565 align:middle line:90%
Now he has great sense of humour.
When I asked him what he's up to...

01:20:04.565 --> 01:20:07.290 align:middle line:84%
he said he's a thief.

01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:12.366 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that wasn't a joke?
- I don't follow you.

01:20:12.366 --> 01:20:15.223 align:middle line:84%
Never mind.

01:20:15.223 --> 01:20:18.427 align:middle line:90%
You know what young men
are like, these days.

01:20:18.427 --> 01:21:59.464 align:middle line:90%
Who knows, they might steal
something valuable.

01:21:59.464 --> 01:22:03.671 align:middle line:90%
The water is deep.
You might drown.

01:22:03.671 --> 01:22:10.903 align:middle line:90%
Not without you
- Is that so? Try that.

01:22:10.903 --> 01:22:31.578 align:middle line:84%
Is that so?

01:22:31.578 --> 01:22:33.991 align:middle line:90%
Hey lady, haven't you finished
dressing yet?

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:38.355 align:middle line:90%
Where are you headed?
Gentlemen don't barge in...

01:22:38.355 --> 01:22:42.821 align:middle line:90%
when ladies are changing dresses.
Don't you know that?

01:22:42.821 --> 01:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
How would I know?

01:22:53.100 --> 01:23:01.726 align:middle line:90%
I'm no gentleman.
- Savage.

01:23:01.726 --> 01:23:05.369 align:middle line:84%
Savage.

01:23:05.369 --> 01:23:12.163 align:middle line:90%
I'm not about to give in
to your type.

01:23:12.163 --> 01:23:15.668 align:middle line:84%
Where are you running away?

01:23:15.668 --> 01:23:20.435 align:middle line:90%
Let go of my hand. What kind
of a stupid joke is this?

01:23:20.435 --> 01:23:21.355 align:middle line:84%
You savage!

01:23:21.355 --> 01:23:24.178 align:middle line:90%
Am I?
- Yes! You're a savage!

01:23:24.178 --> 01:23:27.663 align:middle line:90%
Savage?
I'm a penniless, uneducated tramp!

01:23:27.663 --> 01:23:30.196 align:middle line:84%
I don't fit into high society!

01:23:30.196 --> 01:23:32.675 align:middle line:90%
How dare I maul your fragile body
with my beastly hands.

01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:35.216 align:middle line:90%
I told Ma that childhood friends,
like childhood days are gone...

01:23:35.216 --> 01:23:38.475 align:middle line:84%
never to return.

01:23:38.475 --> 01:23:43.246 align:middle line:84%
Good of you to have told me my class.

01:23:43.246 --> 01:23:46.768 align:middle line:84%
It was a joke. Don't get angry.

01:23:46.768 --> 01:23:58.336 align:middle line:84%
You want to hit me? Go ahead.

01:23:58.336 --> 01:24:02.417 align:middle line:84%
Whom will I hit?

01:24:02.417 --> 01:24:04.598 align:middle line:84%
You?

01:24:04.598 --> 01:24:37.583 align:middle line:84%
Or myself?

01:24:37.583 --> 01:24:42.643 align:middle line:84%
Hey! Hey!

01:24:42.643 --> 01:24:45.731 align:middle line:84%
Are you happy?

01:24:45.731 --> 01:24:48.875 align:middle line:84%
No.

01:24:48.875 --> 01:24:53.765 align:middle line:90%
Where are you lost?
- Up there

01:24:53.765 --> 01:24:58.776 align:middle line:90%
Come back.
- Where to?

01:24:58.776 --> 01:25:02.663 align:middle line:90%
Beside me.
- Why?

01:25:02.663 --> 01:25:13.772 align:middle line:84%
No reason.

01:25:13.772 --> 01:25:19.852 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you ashamed?

01:25:19.852 --> 01:25:25.697 align:middle line:90%
What are you looking at?
The Moon?

01:25:25.697 --> 01:25:30.226 align:middle line:84%
No. Clouds.

01:25:30.226 --> 01:25:33.102 align:middle line:90%
What's your problem?
You don't see the Moon...

01:25:33.102 --> 01:25:38.988 align:middle line:90%
and you see the dark clouds?
Won't you tell me?

01:25:38.988 --> 01:25:42.905 align:middle line:84%
Who else can I tell?

01:25:42.905 --> 01:25:45.896 align:middle line:90%
Rita.
- Yes.

01:25:45.896 --> 01:25:48.795 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing each other
after twelve years.

01:25:48.795 --> 01:25:50.775 align:middle line:84%
So what?

01:25:50.775 --> 01:25:55.773 align:middle line:90%
A lot changes in twelve years.
- The Judge said that too!

01:25:55.773 --> 01:26:01.425 align:middle line:90%
But I don't agree. Look at us.
We're still friends.

01:26:01.425 --> 01:26:08.735 align:middle line:90%
The Judge is right.
You know nothing about me.

01:26:08.735 --> 01:26:10.514 align:middle line:84%
Who I am...

01:26:10.514 --> 01:26:13.394 align:middle line:84%
My circumstances...

01:26:13.394 --> 01:26:16.556 align:middle line:84%
My family background...

01:26:16.556 --> 01:26:21.421 align:middle line:90%
What I have been doing...
what I am doing.

01:26:21.421 --> 01:26:29.255 align:middle line:90%
You know nothing about me.
- Nor do I want to know.

01:26:29.255 --> 01:26:34.840 align:middle line:90%
All I know is that you are
the one I...

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:41.904 align:middle line:90%
Rita, you are so nice.
But so naive.

01:26:41.904 --> 01:26:45.416 align:middle line:90%
And you're such a fool.
A savage.

01:26:45.416 --> 01:26:49.439 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking to you.

01:26:49.439 --> 01:26:52.233 align:middle line:84%
Look.

01:26:52.233 --> 01:26:54.979 align:middle line:84%
The clouds?

01:26:54.979 --> 01:26:59.337 align:middle line:84%
They are moving away from my Moon.

01:26:59.337 --> 01:27:03.645 align:middle line:84%
You know, today's my birthday.

01:27:03.645 --> 01:27:07.852 align:middle line:84%
Which? Tenth? Eleventh?

01:27:07.852 --> 01:27:09.783 align:middle line:84%
You don't ask a lady that.

01:27:09.783 --> 01:27:12.683 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'll whisper it to you.

01:27:12.683 --> 01:27:15.314 align:middle line:84%
Twenty one.

01:27:15.314 --> 01:27:18.321 align:middle line:84%
No! It's looking at us.

01:27:18.321 --> 01:27:24.175 align:middle line:90%
What?
- That!

01:27:24.175 --> 01:27:37.557 align:middle line:84%
"Turn your face away for a moment."

01:27:37.557 --> 01:27:49.924 align:middle line:90%
"Turn your face away for a moment,
O moon."

01:27:49.924 --> 01:27:53.379 align:middle line:84%
"I will love him."

01:27:53.379 --> 01:27:57.831 align:middle line:90%
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

01:27:57.831 --> 01:28:05.199 align:middle line:90%
"Turn your face away for a moment,
O moon."

01:28:05.199 --> 01:28:09.207 align:middle line:84%
"I will love him."

01:28:09.207 --> 01:28:26.405 align:middle line:90%
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

01:28:26.405 --> 01:28:34.453 align:middle line:84%
"The heart worships love."

01:28:34.453 --> 01:28:38.129 align:middle line:84%
"The heart worships love."

01:28:38.129 --> 01:28:42.583 align:middle line:84%
"And even I am with him."

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:46.566 align:middle line:90%
"The stars look at
the moon everyday..

01:28:46.566 --> 01:28:50.345 align:middle line:84%
..but this is my first night."

01:28:50.345 --> 01:28:54.555 align:middle line:84%
"My first night."

01:28:54.555 --> 01:29:01.450 align:middle line:84%
"Go and hide in the clouds, O moon."

01:29:01.450 --> 01:29:05.288 align:middle line:84%
"I will love him."

01:29:05.288 --> 01:29:09.840 align:middle line:90%
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:16.875 align:middle line:84%
"Turn your face here for a moment."

01:29:16.875 --> 01:29:24.627 align:middle line:90%
"Turn your face here for a moment,
O moon."

01:29:24.627 --> 01:29:28.361 align:middle line:84%
"I will love her."

01:29:28.361 --> 01:29:45.675 align:middle line:84%
"I will lock eyes with her."

01:29:45.675 --> 01:29:53.434 align:middle line:84%
"I am a thief, my work is to steal."

01:29:53.434 --> 01:29:57.403 align:middle line:84%
"I am a thief, my work is to steal."

01:29:57.403 --> 01:30:01.710 align:middle line:84%
"I have a bad name in the world."

01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:09.515 align:middle line:90%
"I have been stealing hearts,
this is my work."

01:30:09.515 --> 01:30:12.884 align:middle line:84%
"This is my work."

01:30:12.884 --> 01:30:20.475 align:middle line:84%
"You come as a witness, O moon."

01:30:20.475 --> 01:30:24.271 align:middle line:84%
"I will love her."

01:30:24.271 --> 01:30:41.987 align:middle line:84%
"I will lock eyes with her."

01:30:41.987 --> 01:30:49.748 align:middle line:90%
"Don't get lost after
stealing my heart."

01:30:49.748 --> 01:30:53.728 align:middle line:90%
"Don't get lost after
stealing my heart."

01:30:53.728 --> 01:30:57.619 align:middle line:84%
"Don't forget the path."

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:05.246 align:middle line:90%
"Under these feet don't crush,
the flower of my heart."

01:31:05.246 --> 01:31:08.571 align:middle line:84%
"The flower of my heart."

01:31:08.571 --> 01:31:16.172 align:middle line:84%
"Explain this to him, O moon."

01:31:16.172 --> 01:31:20.964 align:middle line:84%
"I will love him."

01:31:20.964 --> 01:31:23.869 align:middle line:90%
"I will talk to him about
thousand things."

01:31:23.869 --> 01:31:31.538 align:middle line:90%
"Turn your face here for a moment,
O moon."

01:31:31.538 --> 01:31:35.275 align:middle line:84%
"I will love her."

01:31:35.275 --> 01:31:39.992 align:middle line:84%
"I will lock eyes with her."

01:31:39.992 --> 01:31:58.661 align:middle line:84%
"Turn your face away for a moment."

01:31:58.661 --> 01:32:02.500 align:middle line:90%
One step more, and the boat
will turn over and sink.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So what?

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:23.159 align:middle line:84%
Let the boat sink.

01:32:23.159 --> 01:32:23.775 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:32:23.775 --> 01:32:26.394 align:middle line:84%
Yes.

01:32:26.394 --> 01:32:40.804 align:middle line:84%
Judge sir!

01:32:40.804 --> 01:32:44.899 align:middle line:90%
I don't want it
- But the doctor says...

01:32:44.899 --> 01:33:02.636 align:middle line:84%
I should eat by eight.

01:33:02.636 --> 01:33:15.162 align:middle line:90%
Tonight, it's my turn
to be admonished by the clock.

01:33:15.162 --> 01:33:26.148 align:middle line:84%
You are angry with me, aren't you?

01:33:26.148 --> 01:33:28.787 align:middle line:84%
Today I was...

01:33:28.787 --> 01:33:31.219 align:middle line:90%
With Raj?
- Raj is no stranger.

01:33:31.219 --> 01:33:38.451 align:middle line:84%
He's a childhood friend.

01:33:38.451 --> 01:33:40.611 align:middle line:84%
I..

01:33:40.611 --> 01:33:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I..

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:48.281 align:middle line:90%
I made a promise
to your dying father.

01:33:48.281 --> 01:33:51.775 align:middle line:90%
To take care of you
as long as I live.

01:33:51.775 --> 01:33:54.315 align:middle line:84%
You must make a promise.

01:33:54.315 --> 01:34:01.247 align:middle line:90%
If someone likes you,
if you like someone...

01:34:01.247 --> 01:34:04.222 align:middle line:90%
...you will not give your consent
without telling me.

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:09.498 align:middle line:84%
I know, I am much obliged to you.

01:34:09.498 --> 01:34:46.494 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't mean that
you can, time and again...

01:34:46.494 --> 01:34:49.394 align:middle line:84%
Boss?

01:34:49.394 --> 01:34:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Recognise me?
Thank you very much!

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.582 align:middle line:84%
You haven't much time nowadays.

01:34:57.582 --> 01:35:01.804 align:middle line:84%
Well son, are you falling in love?

01:35:01.804 --> 01:35:07.888 align:middle line:90%
Or, have you given up your profession
for fear of going to jail?

01:35:07.888 --> 01:35:11.693 align:middle line:90%
You don't know the size of the scam
I've planned for you.

01:35:11.693 --> 01:35:17.184 align:middle line:90%
She's an heiress.
Just wait for a few days.

01:35:17.184 --> 01:35:21.763 align:middle line:90%
I'm angling for a diamond necklace.
- Bravo!

01:35:21.763 --> 01:35:27.378 align:middle line:90%
I knew it! You aren't the type
to waste your time.

01:35:27.378 --> 01:35:31.150 align:middle line:84%
But remember!

01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:57.118 align:middle line:84%
If you try to cheat Jagga...

01:35:57.118 --> 01:36:06.338 align:middle line:90%
'Nor do I want to know. All I know
is that you are the one I...'

01:36:06.338 --> 01:36:07.935 align:middle line:84%
'Really?'

01:36:07.935 --> 01:38:49.999 align:middle line:90%
'Remember! If you try
to cheat Jagga...'

01:38:49.999 --> 01:38:56.546 align:middle line:90%
"Without you this moonlight
is like fire."

01:38:56.546 --> 01:38:59.211 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:38:59.211 --> 01:39:02.763 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:39:02.763 --> 01:39:08.680 align:middle line:90%
"Without you this moonlight
is like fire."

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:12.119 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:39:12.119 --> 01:39:15.486 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:39:15.486 --> 01:39:20.961 align:middle line:90%
"The flute is not melodious
without you."

01:39:20.961 --> 01:39:27.705 align:middle line:90%
"This life of mine is
a melody of pain."

01:39:27.705 --> 01:39:30.892 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

"Do come."

01:39:46.361 --> 01:39:49.530 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:53.408 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:39:53.408 --> 01:39:55.930 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:39:55.930 --> 01:40:31.906 align:middle line:84%
"Do come."

01:40:31.906 --> 01:40:35.283 align:middle line:90%
"This is not life,
this is not life."

01:40:35.283 --> 01:40:52.896 align:middle line:84%
"This is not life."

01:40:52.896 --> 01:40:57.983 align:middle line:90%
"I am burning alive in
this fire of life."

01:40:57.983 --> 01:41:20.928 align:middle line:84%
"The arrows of fire run through me."

01:41:20.928 --> 01:41:24.477 align:middle line:84%
"I don't want this hell."

01:41:24.477 --> 01:41:29.149 align:middle line:90%
"I want the flower, the
love, the friend."

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:32.735 align:middle line:84%
"I want the spring."

01:41:32.735 --> 01:41:36.481 align:middle line:84%
"I want the spring."

01:41:36.481 --> 01:41:39.516 align:middle line:84%
"I want the spring."

01:41:39.516 --> 01:41:57.949 align:middle line:84%
"I want the spring."

01:41:57.949 --> 01:42:11.580 align:middle line:84%
"Om Namah Shivay."

01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:25.643 align:middle line:84%
"Om Namah Shivay."

01:42:25.643 --> 01:42:59.766 align:middle line:84%
"Om.."

01:42:59.766 --> 01:43:04.968 align:middle line:84%
"My foreigner has returned home."

01:43:04.968 --> 01:43:20.236 align:middle line:84%
"The thirst in my eyes is quenched."

01:43:20.236 --> 01:43:30.373 align:middle line:84%
"You are the pearl of my heart."

01:43:30.373 --> 01:43:40.440 align:middle line:84%

01:45:52.475 --> 01:46:00.957 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:46:00.957 --> 01:46:08.246 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:46:08.246 --> 01:46:18.417 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:46:18.417 --> 01:46:24.467 align:middle line:84%
Rita!

01:46:24.467 --> 01:46:30.476 align:middle line:90%
Mother! Mother, save me. Mother!
- Raju!

01:46:30.476 --> 01:46:33.817 align:middle line:84%
Ma, I want to be good!

01:46:33.817 --> 01:46:37.230 align:middle line:90%
I promise, I won't have anything to do
with Jagga and those others!

01:46:37.230 --> 01:46:41.314 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather starve than steal.
I will be good.

01:46:41.314 --> 01:46:45.474 align:middle line:90%
People will say I'm honest!
Let's go back to our slum.

01:46:45.474 --> 01:46:50.485 align:middle line:90%
I'll work hard for a living.
I won't steal! Ma, I won't steal!

01:46:50.485 --> 01:46:54.185 align:middle line:90%
I want nothing but peace of mind,
and my mother's blessings.

01:46:54.185 --> 01:47:41.442 align:middle line:90%
I won't steal, Ma.
I'll become honest.

01:47:41.442 --> 01:47:45.277 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.

01:47:45.277 --> 01:47:50.992 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?
- You're fired. We won't need you.

01:47:50.992 --> 01:47:53.391 align:middle line:90%
What?
- Go away, get out!

01:47:53.391 --> 01:47:55.803 align:middle line:84%
We don't employ thieves.

01:47:55.803 --> 01:47:59.674 align:middle line:84%
As you wish.

01:47:59.674 --> 01:48:06.302 align:middle line:90%
May I ask something, sir? You say
you don't want to employ thieves?

01:48:06.302 --> 01:48:10.137 align:middle line:90%
Would you rather that they keep
thieving all their lives?

01:48:10.137 --> 01:48:28.947 align:middle line:84%
Get out!

01:48:28.947 --> 01:48:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Raj! Raj!

01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:37.917 align:middle line:90%
Fired?
Come on, the boss is calling you.

01:48:37.917 --> 01:48:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Raj, what reply do I carry back
to the boss?

01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:45.888 align:middle line:84%
This..

01:48:45.888 --> 01:48:47.371 align:middle line:90%
He will either steal
or he will starve.

01:48:47.371 --> 01:48:52.810 align:middle line:90%
And how long will he not steal?
He has no way out of crime.

01:48:52.810 --> 01:49:03.893 align:middle line:84%
Let me see how far he goes.

01:49:03.893 --> 01:49:07.973 align:middle line:84%
Where are you going?

01:49:07.973 --> 01:49:13.438 align:middle line:90%
To see Rita.
- You can't go in. The Judge's orders.

01:49:13.438 --> 01:49:17.877 align:middle line:84%
The Judge's orders?

01:49:17.877 --> 01:49:23.838 align:middle line:90%
Then go and tell her that
Raj is waiting out here to see her.

01:49:23.838 --> 01:49:33.490 align:middle line:90%
I have much to tell her.
- She can't see anyone. Get going.

01:49:33.490 --> 01:49:53.246 align:middle line:84%
Get going? Where to?

01:49:53.246 --> 01:49:56.948 align:middle line:84%
Come friend.

01:49:56.948 --> 01:50:01.263 align:middle line:84%
Let me talk to you.

01:50:01.263 --> 01:50:11.192 align:middle line:90%
Strange coincidence, isn't it?
You're a tramp, I'm a tramp too.

01:50:11.192 --> 01:50:18.442 align:middle line:90%
You have no name,
I have no name either.

01:50:18.442 --> 01:50:26.204 align:middle line:90%
You are homeless,
I have no home either.

01:50:26.204 --> 01:50:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Like me, you too crave for love.

01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:36.648 align:middle line:90%
Difference being only that
you are an animal, and I'm human.

01:50:36.648 --> 01:50:44.672 align:middle line:84%
Human.

01:50:44.672 --> 01:50:48.354 align:middle line:84%
I have nothing to give you.

01:50:48.354 --> 01:51:00.551 align:middle line:84%
I can only give love.

01:51:00.551 --> 01:51:03.967 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you watch your step?
Are you blind?

01:51:03.967 --> 01:51:20.367 align:middle line:90%
Mind your tongue.
Bloody savage.

01:51:20.367 --> 01:51:24.178 align:middle line:84%
Savage... am I a savage?

01:51:24.178 --> 01:52:33.622 align:middle line:90%
Am I a mongrel on the streets?
To be kicked at will or whim?

01:52:33.622 --> 01:52:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Piano-fixer?

01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:48.274 align:middle line:90%
Your servant thinks
I'm here to fix the piano.

01:52:48.274 --> 01:52:53.899 align:middle line:90%
"Please come now,
my desires are squirming."

01:52:53.899 --> 01:52:58.223 align:middle line:90%
"Please come now,
my desires are squirming."

01:52:58.223 --> 01:53:03.296 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:53:03.296 --> 01:53:08.396 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:53:08.396 --> 01:53:13.517 align:middle line:90%
"I lie crying here,
you are silent there."

01:53:13.517 --> 01:53:18.595 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:53:18.595 --> 01:53:31.936 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:53:31.936 --> 01:53:38.929 align:middle line:90%
"The brightness of the
moon is fading."

01:53:38.929 --> 01:53:51.988 align:middle line:90%
"Even the hearts of stars
are vanishing. Vanishing."

01:53:51.988 --> 01:53:56.804 align:middle line:84%
"The fervent ambiance is painful."

01:53:56.804 --> 01:54:01.917 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:54:01.917 --> 01:54:17.238 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:54:17.238 --> 01:54:25.381 align:middle line:84%
"In the palanquin of the moon."

01:54:25.381 --> 01:54:30.240 align:middle line:84%
"In the palanquin of the moon."

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:40.908 align:middle line:90%
"Where is the bride of night going to?
Where is she going?"

01:54:40.908 --> 01:54:53.231 align:middle line:84%
"Even the fate is about to sleep."

01:54:53.231 --> 01:54:58.737 align:middle line:90%
"You do not arrive,
where will I go?"

01:54:58.737 --> 01:55:03.271 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:55:03.271 --> 01:55:08.358 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:55:08.358 --> 01:55:13.499 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:55:13.499 --> 01:55:18.458 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:55:18.458 --> 01:55:23.700 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:55:23.700 --> 01:56:06.254 align:middle line:84%
"Now the night is about to pass."

01:56:06.254 --> 01:56:13.521 align:middle line:84%
Rita.

01:56:13.521 --> 01:56:15.863 align:middle line:84%
Rita.

01:56:15.863 --> 01:56:19.549 align:middle line:84%
Rita.

01:56:19.549 --> 01:56:25.314 align:middle line:84%
The invitations have been printed.

01:56:25.314 --> 01:56:28.598 align:middle line:90%
The day after tomorrow
is your birthday, isn't it?

01:56:28.598 --> 01:56:35.174 align:middle line:90%
Send them to the friends
you want to invite.

01:56:35.174 --> 01:56:44.784 align:middle line:84%
All my friends?

01:56:44.784 --> 01:57:01.283 align:middle line:90%
Yes, all friends. All, who are
worthy of being your friends.

01:57:01.283 --> 01:57:08.461 align:middle line:84%
Your birthday.

01:57:08.461 --> 01:57:11.963 align:middle line:84%
Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?

01:57:11.963 --> 01:57:16.318 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have money to buy anything.
I'll give you some other time.

01:57:16.318 --> 01:57:20.585 align:middle line:90%
Must you only buy something
to make a gift?

01:57:20.585 --> 01:57:23.140 align:middle line:84%
You can give me a flower.

01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:26.531 align:middle line:90%
Someday, I'm going to make
lots of money.

01:57:26.531 --> 01:57:45.704 align:middle line:90%
And I'll buy a gift for you.
Something better than all this.

01:57:45.704 --> 01:57:51.275 align:middle line:90%
Back? I knew someday,
you'd surely come back.

01:57:51.275 --> 01:57:54.985 align:middle line:84%
For you, this is the only door open.

01:57:54.985 --> 01:58:02.105 align:middle line:90%
I need a thousand. A loan
I'll return it after I've earned it.

01:58:02.105 --> 01:58:06.575 align:middle line:90%
Loan? What d'you think I am,
a money-lender?

01:58:06.575 --> 01:58:14.701 align:middle line:90%
Today is Rita's birthday.
Look, she has invited me.

01:58:14.701 --> 01:58:19.735 align:middle line:90%
She takes me for a gentleman.
- So you must dress like a gentleman.

01:58:19.735 --> 01:58:28.819 align:middle line:90%
And to prove yourself, you must
also make a gift to the lady.

01:58:28.819 --> 01:58:33.935 align:middle line:90%
So gentlemanliness is for sale,
and you intend buying some?

01:58:33.935 --> 01:58:40.126 align:middle line:90%
But to become a gentleman, you need
money. One thousand Rupees.

01:58:40.126 --> 01:58:47.501 align:middle line:90%
For that thousand, you have to steal,
rob, or maybe even kill someone for me.

01:58:47.501 --> 01:58:50.327 align:middle line:90%
Do you accept?
- No.

01:58:50.327 --> 01:58:55.434 align:middle line:90%
No! I won't rob!
I won't commit crimes!

01:58:55.434 --> 01:59:01.620 align:middle line:84%
What other way out have you?

01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:06.987 align:middle line:90%
Once a criminal, you can never
become a gentleman again!

01:59:06.987 --> 01:59:10.924 align:middle line:90%
No matter how many times
you change your clothes.

01:59:10.924 --> 01:59:15.612 align:middle line:90%
Crime is written all over your face!
You even tried working.

01:59:15.612 --> 01:59:18.874 align:middle line:90%
Not for you, the bread
in the sweat of thy face.

01:59:18.874 --> 01:59:24.783 align:middle line:90%
For you, the only resort
is thieving, crime.

01:59:24.783 --> 01:59:26.504 align:middle line:84%
Same as mine!

01:59:26.504 --> 02:00:06.927 align:middle line:84%
All thanks to your father.

02:00:06.927 --> 02:00:10.751 align:middle line:84%
Watch your step, son.

02:00:10.751 --> 02:00:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I try. But what to do?
Out on the streets...

02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:44.456 align:middle line:90%
...there are those big guns like you.
- Sharp, are you?

02:00:44.456 --> 02:00:59.846 align:middle line:84%
Wow Dewan sir, how nicely you said!

02:00:59.846 --> 02:01:01.686 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen Rita?

02:01:01.686 --> 02:01:07.107 align:middle line:84%
I will show you.

02:01:07.107 --> 02:01:09.209 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:09.209 --> 02:01:10.978 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:10.978 --> 02:01:12.688 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:12.688 --> 02:01:14.735 align:middle line:84%
"And so say all of us."

02:01:14.735 --> 02:01:16.437 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

02:01:16.437 --> 02:01:18.232 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

02:01:18.232 --> 02:01:20.322 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:20.322 --> 02:01:22.109 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:24.750 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:25.990 align:middle line:84%
"And so say all of us."

02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:30.728 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

02:01:30.728 --> 02:01:31.492 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:31.492 --> 02:01:33.411 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:33.411 --> 02:01:35.205 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:35.205 --> 02:01:36.994 align:middle line:84%
"And so say all of us."

02:01:36.994 --> 02:01:39.758 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

02:01:39.758 --> 02:01:41.577 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

02:01:41.577 --> 02:01:42.712 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:42.712 --> 02:01:44.568 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:44.568 --> 02:01:46.418 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:46.418 --> 02:01:48.294 align:middle line:84%
"And so say all of us."

02:01:48.294 --> 02:01:50.707 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

02:01:50.707 --> 02:01:52.682 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

02:01:52.682 --> 02:01:53.925 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:53.925 --> 02:01:55.815 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:55.815 --> 02:01:57.715 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:01:57.715 --> 02:01:59.514 align:middle line:84%
"And so say all of us."

02:01:59.514 --> 02:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:03.306 align:middle line:84%
"Hip Hip Hip Hip Hurray."

02:02:03.306 --> 02:02:04.606 align:middle line:84%
"He is a jolly good fellow."

02:02:04.606 --> 02:02:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Tell me something.
- What?

02:02:08.410 --> 02:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Who are you looking for?

02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:17.844 align:middle line:84%
Want me to tell you?

02:02:17.844 --> 02:02:25.956 align:middle line:84%
Look, over there.

02:02:25.956 --> 02:02:31.116 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:02:31.116 --> 02:02:35.636 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:02:35.636 --> 02:02:41.352 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:02:41.352 --> 02:02:45.195 align:middle line:84%
So you came.

02:02:45.195 --> 02:02:52.614 align:middle line:84%
Happy twenty-first.

02:02:52.614 --> 02:02:59.342 align:middle line:90%
Your gift.
- Why did you have to do this?

02:02:59.342 --> 02:03:03.187 align:middle line:90%
Why did you have to buy
such an expensive necklace?

02:03:03.187 --> 02:03:10.948 align:middle line:90%
For you, nothing is too expensive.
Besides, I stole it.

02:03:10.948 --> 02:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
You stole it?
- I stole it from the stars.

02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:18.920 align:middle line:90%
You're such a...
- A savage?

02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:22.463 align:middle line:84%
What else? You are a savage.

02:03:22.463 --> 02:03:25.889 align:middle line:84%
You buy this expensive gift...

02:03:25.889 --> 02:03:30.491 align:middle line:90%
but you won't spend
for a velvet case.

02:03:30.491 --> 02:03:32.272 align:middle line:84%
Case?

02:03:32.272 --> 02:03:36.849 align:middle line:90%
Rita, the Judge is calling you.
Hurry up.

02:03:36.849 --> 02:03:43.782 align:middle line:84%
Coming.

02:03:43.782 --> 02:03:50.123 align:middle line:84%
What's on your mind?

02:03:50.123 --> 02:03:54.405 align:middle line:84%
Let me introduce you to the Judge.

02:03:54.405 --> 02:04:23.106 align:middle line:84%
Come on.

02:04:23.106 --> 02:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Rita, I've been waiting for you.

02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:37.563 align:middle line:90%
First, my present.
- See if you like it.

02:04:37.563 --> 02:04:41.316 align:middle line:84%
Why, don't you like it?

02:04:41.316 --> 02:04:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Today's a strange day. Someone
gives me a necklace sans a case.

02:04:45.410 --> 02:05:08.488 align:middle line:90%
And someone give me a case
sans the necklace.

02:05:08.488 --> 02:05:14.965 align:middle line:90%
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

02:05:14.965 --> 02:05:20.580 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:27.367 align:middle line:90%
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

02:05:27.367 --> 02:05:44.386 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:05:44.386 --> 02:05:50.328 align:middle line:90%
"A man with an innocent face,
turned out to be a thief."

02:05:50.328 --> 02:05:56.367 align:middle line:90%
"He hides the darkness inside,
but his face is bright."

02:05:56.367 --> 02:06:02.353 align:middle line:90%
"A man with an innocent face,
turned out to be a thief."

02:06:02.353 --> 02:06:07.537 align:middle line:90%
"He hides the darkness inside,
but his face is bright."

02:06:07.537 --> 02:06:13.856 align:middle line:90%
"I gave my heart,
I made myself fervent."

02:06:13.856 --> 02:06:19.469 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:06:19.469 --> 02:06:25.942 align:middle line:90%
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

02:06:25.942 --> 02:06:38.798 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:06:38.798 --> 02:06:44.163 align:middle line:90%
"I was betrayed,
by his cobalt blue eyes."

02:06:44.163 --> 02:06:51.347 align:middle line:84%
"The cobalt blue eyes."

02:06:51.347 --> 02:06:56.539 align:middle line:90%
"I was betrayed,
by his cobalt blue eyes."

02:06:56.539 --> 02:07:00.100 align:middle line:84%
"The cobalt blue eyes."

02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:06.554 align:middle line:90%
"The heart is lonely,
the eyes are wet."

02:07:06.554 --> 02:07:08.506 align:middle line:84%
"The eyes are wet."

02:07:08.506 --> 02:07:14.756 align:middle line:90%
"I trusted him.
I proposed my love to him."

02:07:14.756 --> 02:07:20.302 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:07:20.302 --> 02:07:27.375 align:middle line:90%
"I loved a betrayer,
I locked eyes with him."

02:07:27.375 --> 02:07:42.270 align:middle line:90%
"O God, what did I do,
what did I do?"

02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:47.957 align:middle line:84%
Rita, what have you done?

02:07:47.957 --> 02:07:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Fallen in love with a thief?

02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:55.818 align:middle line:84%
And Raju, you?

02:07:55.818 --> 02:08:00.492 align:middle line:84%
Is it some gift you don't like?

02:08:00.492 --> 02:08:10.181 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to return his gift.

02:08:10.181 --> 02:08:14.212 align:middle line:84%
Rita.

02:08:14.212 --> 02:08:33.869 align:middle line:90%
Bring him over.
I'd like to meet him.

02:08:33.869 --> 02:08:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Raj isn't a bad boy.
He has just gone astray.

02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:44.857 align:middle line:90%
All he needs is someone to love him,
to support him, to bring him around.

02:08:44.857 --> 02:08:51.269 align:middle line:90%
He respects you. If you want it,
Raj can be saved.

02:08:51.269 --> 02:08:55.704 align:middle line:90%
Is Raj not at home?
- No. He went out early in the morning.

02:08:55.704 --> 02:09:00.557 align:middle line:84%
He isn't back yet.

02:09:00.557 --> 02:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Okay, mother.

02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:24.712 align:middle line:90%
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

02:09:24.712 --> 02:09:30.429 align:middle line:90%
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:36.148 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:09:36.148 --> 02:09:41.678 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:09:41.678 --> 02:09:47.520 align:middle line:90%
"I happily endure the
perils of love."

02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:53.801 align:middle line:90%
"I happily endure the
perils of love."

02:09:53.801 --> 02:09:58.865 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:09:58.865 --> 02:10:13.108 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:10:13.108 --> 02:10:21.552 align:middle line:90%
"What do you know the
love of the heart!"

02:10:21.552 --> 02:10:30.637 align:middle line:90%
"A pain aroused, and my
eyes brimmed with tears."

02:10:30.637 --> 02:10:38.585 align:middle line:90%
"What do you know the
love of the heart!"

02:10:38.585 --> 02:10:44.267 align:middle line:90%
"A pain aroused, and my
eyes brimmed with tears."

02:10:44.267 --> 02:10:49.829 align:middle line:84%
"My eyes brimmed with tears."

02:10:49.829 --> 02:10:55.372 align:middle line:84%
"But I remained silent."

02:10:55.372 --> 02:11:01.129 align:middle line:90%
"But I remained silent,
I swear on this sadness."

02:11:01.129 --> 02:11:06.716 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:11:06.716 --> 02:11:20.879 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:11:20.879 --> 02:11:29.951 align:middle line:90%
"When the heart burned,
there was a fire."

02:11:29.951 --> 02:11:37.758 align:middle line:84%
"When my tears flowed, it rained."

02:11:37.758 --> 02:11:46.364 align:middle line:90%
"When the heart burned,
there was a fire."

02:11:46.364 --> 02:11:52.400 align:middle line:84%
"When my tears flowed, it rained."

02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
"It rained."

02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:03.284 align:middle line:84%
"Like a cloud."

02:12:03.284 --> 02:12:08.938 align:middle line:84%
"Like a cloud, I was a vagabond."

02:12:08.938 --> 02:12:14.649 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:12:14.649 --> 02:12:20.241 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:12:20.241 --> 02:12:25.913 align:middle line:90%
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

02:12:25.913 --> 02:12:31.586 align:middle line:90%
"By falling in love
with you, beloved."

02:12:31.586 --> 02:12:37.268 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:12:37.268 --> 02:12:46.225 align:middle line:90%
"I kept crying, and
I also kept smiling."

02:12:46.225 --> 02:12:50.404 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:12:50.404 --> 02:12:56.224 align:middle line:90%
There you are. Haven't you
brought the police along?

02:12:56.224 --> 02:12:59.934 align:middle line:84%
That bitterness is of no use.

02:12:59.934 --> 02:13:04.869 align:middle line:84%
Your mother has told me everything.

02:13:04.869 --> 02:13:10.849 align:middle line:90%
So you know I'm vagabond,
I've been to jail...

02:13:10.849 --> 02:13:16.234 align:middle line:90%
...and my name is on the police rolls.
Is that what you've come to tell me?

02:13:16.234 --> 02:13:23.254 align:middle line:90%
Try to understand me, Raj.
I still consider you my friend.

02:13:23.254 --> 02:13:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Friend?

02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:34.138 align:middle line:90%
A lawyer's daughter, a judge's ward
takes a tramp for a friend?

02:13:34.138 --> 02:13:38.539 align:middle line:90%
What's your society going to say?
What will your people say?

02:13:38.539 --> 02:13:42.964 align:middle line:90%
If you recant, society
will forgive your past.

02:13:42.964 --> 02:13:47.461 align:middle line:90%
Raj, you can make a new life
for yourself... you can!

02:13:47.461 --> 02:13:52.796 align:middle line:90%
A new life? On what
will I build a new life?

02:13:52.796 --> 02:13:58.648 align:middle line:90%
Can you give me back my childhood,
the education I never had?

02:13:58.648 --> 02:14:04.456 align:middle line:90%
Everyone says that I have no father
to name... I have no honour!

02:14:04.456 --> 02:14:08.345 align:middle line:90%
Can you bring my father back?
Can you give me my name?

02:14:08.345 --> 02:14:14.727 align:middle line:90%
Can you give me my honour?
Tell me... tell me Rita!

02:14:14.727 --> 02:14:18.177 align:middle line:84%
Why are you quiet?

02:14:18.177 --> 02:14:25.102 align:middle line:90%
Rita, I've kept you in the dark.
I've kept myself in the dark.

02:14:25.102 --> 02:14:30.756 align:middle line:90%
Forget me Rita.
Leave me to myself.

02:14:30.756 --> 02:14:32.967 align:middle line:84%
I am not worthy of you.

02:14:32.967 --> 02:14:35.229 align:middle line:90%
You realise fully well,
yet you want to live in this hell.

02:14:35.229 --> 02:14:38.499 align:middle line:84%
I never imagined you'd be so weak.

02:14:38.499 --> 02:14:42.568 align:middle line:90%
Rita, don't you think I never tried
to get out of this hell.

02:14:42.568 --> 02:14:45.432 align:middle line:84%
But tell me, what do I do?

02:14:45.432 --> 02:14:49.350 align:middle line:90%
For twelve years, the world
has chased me towards crime.

02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:52.662 align:middle line:84%
Alone, I cannot face it.

02:14:52.662 --> 02:14:56.229 align:middle line:84%
Alone, I cannot.

02:14:56.229 --> 02:15:01.502 align:middle line:90%
You aren't alone, Raj.
Your mother is with you.

02:15:01.502 --> 02:15:07.985 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.
- You? With me? With a criminal?

02:15:07.985 --> 02:15:13.813 align:middle line:84%
Yes Raj. With you, forever.

02:15:13.813 --> 02:15:23.601 align:middle line:90%
Good or not, guilty or not,
whatever you are, you're mine.

02:15:23.601 --> 02:15:30.622 align:middle line:90%
This is a matter of the heart. And
the scales of justice cannot judge it.

02:15:30.622 --> 02:15:36.885 align:middle line:90%
But this guilt I carry
with me forever?

02:15:36.885 --> 02:15:45.452 align:middle line:90%
For me, as your wife, it will
be the bride's vermillion.

02:15:45.452 --> 02:15:48.642 align:middle line:84%
Really?

02:15:48.642 --> 02:15:51.806 align:middle line:90%
Come with me.
- Where?

02:15:51.806 --> 02:15:55.924 align:middle line:84%
The Judge wants to meet you.

02:15:55.924 --> 02:16:15.736 align:middle line:90%
The Judge?
- Yes.

02:16:15.736 --> 02:16:26.777 align:middle line:84%
Sit.

02:16:26.777 --> 02:16:29.192 align:middle line:84%
Name?

02:16:29.192 --> 02:16:30.819 align:middle line:84%
Raj.

02:16:30.819 --> 02:16:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Only Raj?
- Yes.

02:16:38.630 --> 02:16:40.266 align:middle line:84%
Your father's name?

02:16:40.266 --> 02:16:50.966 align:middle line:84%
I don't know.

02:16:50.966 --> 02:16:53.429 align:middle line:90%
I see.
What do you do?

02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:58.195 align:middle line:90%
As of now, unemployed.
Like millions of others.

02:16:58.195 --> 02:17:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Any other source of income?
Property?

02:17:04.350 --> 02:17:05.852 align:middle line:84%
Nothing.

02:17:05.852 --> 02:17:11.327 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember polishing boots
when you were a boy?

02:17:11.327 --> 02:17:13.877 align:middle line:84%
I still do.

02:17:13.877 --> 02:17:20.201 align:middle line:90%
And you want to marry Rita?
- Yes. If you allow me.

02:17:20.201 --> 02:17:22.961 align:middle line:90%
And you've been to jail too?
- Rita must've told you that...

02:17:22.961 --> 02:17:27.996 align:middle line:90%
You've recanted? Have you found
another source of making money?

02:17:27.996 --> 02:17:33.527 align:middle line:90%
No.
- But there's still hope, isn't it?

02:17:33.527 --> 02:17:39.456 align:middle line:90%
If some silly rich girl marries you...
- Did you call me here to insult me?

02:17:39.456 --> 02:17:42.852 align:middle line:84%
Judge sir..

02:17:42.852 --> 02:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
We are in love.

02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:50.599 align:middle line:90%
We want to marry.
- All that I've heard.

02:17:50.599 --> 02:17:54.163 align:middle line:84%
Love!

02:17:54.163 --> 02:17:57.762 align:middle line:84%
Sit.

02:17:57.762 --> 02:17:59.724 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk it over
with a cool head.

02:17:59.724 --> 02:18:02.845 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?
- I mean that though I don't know...

02:18:02.845 --> 02:18:06.207 align:middle line:90%
..how you managed to seduce
a naive girl..

02:18:06.207 --> 02:18:10.298 align:middle line:84%
..it's clear why you played this trick.

02:18:10.298 --> 02:18:17.522 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what price
you'll take to let her go.

02:18:17.522 --> 02:18:20.251 align:middle line:84%
Judge Raghunath.

02:18:20.251 --> 02:18:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Till today, I thought
I was the worst scoundrel on earth.

02:18:27.350 --> 02:18:30.337 align:middle line:90%
But you turn out to be
one up on me!

02:18:30.337 --> 02:18:34.388 align:middle line:90%
You scum! How dare you use
your filthy colloquy?

02:18:34.388 --> 02:18:38.504 align:middle line:90%
You think I'm going to let
Rita marry a tramp like you?

02:18:38.504 --> 02:18:44.529 align:middle line:90%
She'd rather stay a spinster for life.
Better by far that she dies!

02:18:44.529 --> 02:18:52.159 align:middle line:90%
Why not say that you'd rather
she married some rich big-shot?

02:18:52.159 --> 02:19:11.326 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe, some judge?
- Out of here. Get out.

02:19:11.326 --> 02:19:16.176 align:middle line:90%
Before I leave, I'd like
to ask you a question.

02:19:16.176 --> 02:19:20.958 align:middle line:90%
What if it was your son in my place?
And because he's poor...

02:19:20.958 --> 02:19:28.237 align:middle line:90%
..because he was brought up in the slums
and was forced into crime...

02:19:28.237 --> 02:19:31.734 align:middle line:90%
...what if it was he who was being
denied his love, his life?

02:19:31.734 --> 02:19:46.417 align:middle line:84%
How would you have felt?

02:19:46.417 --> 02:19:51.415 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:19:51.415 --> 02:19:53.372 align:middle line:84%
Raj! Raj!

02:19:53.372 --> 02:19:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Jagga has called you.

02:19:56.360 --> 02:20:35.876 align:middle line:90%
There's a big heist.
A bank is to be looted.

02:20:35.876 --> 02:20:39.649 align:middle line:84%
Open the door!

02:20:39.649 --> 02:20:42.378 align:middle line:90%
Open up.
- Who is it?

02:20:42.378 --> 02:20:45.258 align:middle line:84%
Open up!

02:20:45.258 --> 02:20:50.805 align:middle line:84%
Open the door!

02:20:50.805 --> 02:21:00.362 align:middle line:90%
Who is there?
- Open the door!

02:21:00.362 --> 02:21:03.481 align:middle line:84%
Who are you?

02:21:03.481 --> 02:21:07.378 align:middle line:84%
Don't you know me?

02:21:07.378 --> 02:21:11.151 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jagga.

02:21:11.151 --> 02:21:13.539 align:middle line:84%
Jagga!

02:21:13.539 --> 02:21:18.187 align:middle line:90%
The bandit?
- You could say so.

02:21:18.187 --> 02:21:23.775 align:middle line:90%
What do you want here?
- Silence!

02:21:23.775 --> 02:21:29.315 align:middle line:90%
The police are after me.
Where's Raj?

02:21:29.315 --> 02:21:38.488 align:middle line:90%
Get out of my house! I will do nothing
to help someone like you!

02:21:38.488 --> 02:21:45.816 align:middle line:90%
I had you once, and I let you go
Remember the day?

02:21:45.816 --> 02:21:51.615 align:middle line:90%
For twelve years, I cared for your son.
I made his life! For this day?

02:21:51.615 --> 02:21:56.540 align:middle line:90%
Made my son's life?
You forced him into crime.

02:21:56.540 --> 02:22:00.831 align:middle line:90%
Get out of my house. I don't want
your cursed shadow upon my son!

02:22:00.831 --> 02:22:03.522 align:middle line:84%
Get out! Get out of my house!

02:22:03.522 --> 02:22:10.477 align:middle line:84%
Police! Police!

02:22:10.477 --> 02:22:13.743 align:middle line:90%
Go on! Call the police!
- Police!

02:22:13.743 --> 02:22:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Let me see who saves you!
Scream!

02:22:17.470 --> 02:22:24.339 align:middle line:84%
Jagga!

02:22:24.339 --> 02:22:33.179 align:middle line:90%
Will you challenge your boss?
- You're no boss. You're Satan!

02:22:33.179 --> 02:22:45.151 align:middle line:84%
Satan!

02:22:45.151 --> 02:23:13.294 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear what you have to say now.

02:23:13.294 --> 02:23:17.288 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:23:17.288 --> 02:23:24.545 align:middle line:84%
Raj! No! No! Mercy!

02:23:24.545 --> 02:23:27.742 align:middle line:84%
No! Enough!

02:23:27.742 --> 02:24:03.528 align:middle line:84%
Jagga!

02:24:03.528 --> 02:24:25.150 align:middle line:90%
What have you done Raj?
- For my sins, this is atonement!

02:24:25.150 --> 02:24:43.475 align:middle line:84%
Police!

02:24:43.475 --> 02:24:53.136 align:middle line:84%
The accused may be presented.

02:24:53.136 --> 02:25:03.574 align:middle line:90%
What's the name of the accused?
- Sir, his name is Raj.

02:25:03.574 --> 02:25:10.634 align:middle line:90%
Father's name?
- Not known, sir. Maybe he has none.

02:25:10.634 --> 02:25:13.597 align:middle line:84%
Order!

02:25:13.597 --> 02:25:20.991 align:middle line:90%
Raj, you have been accused
of killing Jagga.

02:25:20.991 --> 02:25:25.661 align:middle line:90%
Do you have anything to say
in your defence?

02:25:25.661 --> 02:25:34.621 align:middle line:90%
Have you not appointed a lawyer
to defend yourself?

02:25:34.621 --> 02:25:40.403 align:middle line:90%
The case is adjourned. The government
will appoint a counsel for the defence.

02:25:40.403 --> 02:25:46.526 align:middle line:90%
I know the law. Raj killed
in self-defence. That's no crime.

02:25:46.526 --> 02:25:50.623 align:middle line:84%
Please save my Raj, somehow.

02:25:50.623 --> 02:25:54.351 align:middle line:90%
Your deposition is very important.
The whole case hinges on it.

02:25:54.351 --> 02:26:17.667 align:middle line:90%
Come to the court tomorrow.
- All right. Okay, dear.

02:26:17.667 --> 02:26:24.704 align:middle line:84%
Husband!

02:26:24.704 --> 02:26:26.837 align:middle line:84%
She is unconscious.

02:26:26.837 --> 02:26:30.351 align:middle line:84%
Move back! Move! Move!

02:26:30.351 --> 02:26:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Is she dead?
- She has been hurt on the head.

02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:45.466 align:middle line:90%
And Raj killed Jagga
to save my life.

02:26:45.466 --> 02:26:51.342 align:middle line:90%
Please sign here. This deposition
will surely save Raj.

02:26:51.342 --> 02:26:57.541 align:middle line:90%
If Raj is saved, I will be able
to die in peace.

02:26:57.541 --> 02:27:12.852 align:middle line:84%
I should be leaving now.

02:27:12.852 --> 02:27:14.682 align:middle line:84%
Mother!

02:27:14.682 --> 02:27:16.648 align:middle line:90%
My son!
- What happened to you, Ma?

02:27:16.648 --> 02:27:17.884 align:middle line:84%
My son!

02:27:17.884 --> 02:27:22.490 align:middle line:90%
That heartless judge has killed you!
What is his enmity with us?

02:27:22.490 --> 02:27:24.958 align:middle line:90%
You mustn't blame him, son.
- Why not?

02:27:24.958 --> 02:27:26.803 align:middle line:90%
He has always been tying
to make us miserable.

02:27:26.803 --> 02:27:32.359 align:middle line:84%
No son! He is your father.

02:27:32.359 --> 02:27:34.627 align:middle line:84%
My father?

02:27:34.627 --> 02:27:39.777 align:middle line:90%
What are you saying, Ma?
What has come over you?

02:27:39.777 --> 02:27:45.678 align:middle line:90%
I'm not out of my mind, son.
What I'm saying is the truth.

02:27:45.678 --> 02:27:48.591 align:middle line:90%
I could not bring myself
to tell you this until now.

02:27:48.591 --> 02:27:55.100 align:middle line:90%
But if not today, once I'm gone
who else could tell you?

02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:59.616 align:middle line:90%
This can't be, Ma!
This can never be!

02:27:59.616 --> 02:28:05.838 align:middle line:90%
This is a long story.
But I don't have the time.

02:28:05.838 --> 02:28:12.238 align:middle line:84%
Keep this. I'm leaving.

02:28:12.238 --> 02:28:16.435 align:middle line:90%
He will surely recognise you
when you show him this.

02:28:16.435 --> 02:28:21.280 align:middle line:84%
He has never forgiven me.

02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:28.293 align:middle line:84%
But he will surely forgive his son.

02:28:28.293 --> 02:28:32.361 align:middle line:90%
I won't seek mercy from the one
who tortured my mother all her life...

02:28:32.361 --> 02:28:39.206 align:middle line:90%
..the one who made her beg from door
to door. I won't have his mercy!

02:28:39.206 --> 02:28:42.162 align:middle line:84%
Ma, I won't have his mercy!

02:28:42.162 --> 02:28:48.336 align:middle line:90%
If I could see him for
once before I died...

02:28:48.336 --> 02:28:50.686 align:middle line:84%
But why would he come here.

02:28:50.686 --> 02:28:54.538 align:middle line:90%
Come.
- I'm leaving Ma.

02:28:54.538 --> 02:28:55.728 align:middle line:84%
Son!

02:28:55.728 --> 02:28:58.376 align:middle line:90%
I'll avenge you, I will.
- No!

02:28:58.376 --> 02:29:01.266 align:middle line:90%
I'll surely avenge you, I will.
- No, son!.

02:29:01.266 --> 02:29:11.265 align:middle line:84%
Son!

02:29:11.265 --> 02:29:14.368 align:middle line:84%
The Judge is here to see you.

02:29:14.368 --> 02:29:26.782 align:middle line:90%
Which Judge?
- The one whose car ran you over.

02:29:26.782 --> 02:29:31.857 align:middle line:84%
So he has come... before I'm dead.

02:29:31.857 --> 02:29:35.666 align:middle line:84%
Alas, I cannot see.

02:29:35.666 --> 02:29:41.762 align:middle line:84%
Nurse, give him my greetings.

02:29:41.762 --> 02:29:47.804 align:middle line:90%
I am ashamed about the accident.
Please forgive me.

02:29:47.804 --> 02:29:59.146 align:middle line:84%
Forgive you?

02:29:59.146 --> 02:30:40.735 align:middle line:84%
Doctor!

02:30:40.735 --> 02:30:43.319 align:middle line:84%
Mother!

02:30:43.319 --> 02:30:48.224 align:middle line:84%
You didn't die! You were killed!

02:30:48.224 --> 02:31:18.501 align:middle line:90%
That heartless judge has killed you!
To make sure that he isn't exposed!

02:31:18.501 --> 02:31:32.163 align:middle line:84%
Judge sir!

02:31:32.163 --> 02:31:34.357 align:middle line:84%
Judge sir!

02:31:34.357 --> 02:31:41.247 align:middle line:90%
Have you decided the verdict
about the case?

02:31:41.247 --> 02:31:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Case?
- Raj's case.

02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:52.444 align:middle line:90%
You are going mad!
What are you doing to yourself?

02:31:52.444 --> 02:31:56.216 align:middle line:84%
You are a mature, educated woman.

02:31:56.216 --> 02:31:59.457 align:middle line:90%
In a few days, you'll start
going to court as a lawyer.

02:31:59.457 --> 02:32:06.957 align:middle line:90%
You might even make a judge.
If you get emotional over every case...

02:32:06.957 --> 02:32:08.642 align:middle line:90%
..you will never be able to
dispense justice.

02:32:08.642 --> 02:32:16.250 align:middle line:90%
This is not a lawsuit.
It's my life!

02:32:16.250 --> 02:32:21.545 align:middle line:90%
Do you not understand as much?
- Irrespective, it won't alter the law.

02:32:21.545 --> 02:32:23.643 align:middle line:90%
Nor should you let your emotions
come in the way of justice.

02:32:23.643 --> 02:32:27.983 align:middle line:90%
Justice is all I seek.
Raj is completely innocent.

02:32:27.983 --> 02:32:30.823 align:middle line:90%
He killed Jagga tying to save
his mother.

02:32:30.823 --> 02:32:34.664 align:middle line:90%
You can read his mother's
dying declaration.

02:32:34.664 --> 02:32:37.988 align:middle line:90%
In this particular case,
Raj might merit pardon.

02:32:37.988 --> 02:32:41.960 align:middle line:90%
But his whole life is a long story
of involvement with crime and sin.

02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:47.678 align:middle line:90%
I cannot comprehend how you can
sympathise with such a person.

02:32:47.678 --> 02:32:52.543 align:middle line:84%
How can you love him?

02:32:52.543 --> 02:33:02.581 align:middle line:84%
You have studied the law.

02:33:02.581 --> 02:33:08.603 align:middle line:84%
But my heart has not read the laws.

02:33:08.603 --> 02:33:14.737 align:middle line:84%
Heart... and the laws.

02:33:14.737 --> 02:33:21.374 align:middle line:84%
The laws... and the heart.

02:33:21.374 --> 02:33:25.227 align:middle line:84%
What a strange concoction.

02:33:25.227 --> 02:33:29.433 align:middle line:84%
But you are right.

02:33:29.433 --> 02:33:33.529 align:middle line:84%
The heart heeds no laws.

02:33:33.529 --> 02:33:37.690 align:middle line:84%
No laws at all.

02:33:37.690 --> 02:33:59.963 align:middle line:84%
Not even mine.

02:33:59.963 --> 02:34:03.775 align:middle line:90%
No!
- Get out, Rita.

02:34:03.775 --> 02:34:07.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a murderous rage!
- Have you gone mad?

02:34:07.490 --> 02:34:11.564 align:middle line:90%
So you have escaped?
- Yes.

02:34:11.564 --> 02:34:13.194 align:middle line:84%
To settle the score with you.

02:34:13.194 --> 02:34:13.856 align:middle line:84%
Raj..

02:34:13.856 --> 02:34:21.127 align:middle line:90%
Then you will be happy to know
that your lawyer...

02:34:21.127 --> 02:34:24.635 align:middle line:90%
...had just convinced me
about your innocence.

02:34:24.635 --> 02:34:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I was inclined to let you off
tomorrow.

02:34:28.300 --> 02:34:31.743 align:middle line:84%
I want no mercy from you.

02:34:31.743 --> 02:34:34.874 align:middle line:90%
I don't want your justice,
your law, nothing!

02:34:34.874 --> 02:34:40.214 align:middle line:84%
All I want...

02:34:40.214 --> 02:34:46.337 align:middle line:90%
Lost your nerve?
You need guts to kill someone.

02:34:46.337 --> 02:34:53.341 align:middle line:90%
You should be thanking the one
who has just saved your life.

02:34:53.341 --> 02:34:56.186 align:middle line:90%
What if I were to use this very knife
to rip your heart out?

02:34:56.186 --> 02:34:59.653 align:middle line:90%
What else can the verdict
of the courts be?

02:34:59.653 --> 02:35:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Judge Raghunath was compelled to kill
a criminal to save his own life.

02:35:03.470 --> 02:35:14.739 align:middle line:90%
Have you gone out of your mind too?
- I was. For a second.

02:35:14.739 --> 02:35:21.372 align:middle line:90%
For the scum that he is,
the hangman's noose will be better.

02:35:21.372 --> 02:35:26.272 align:middle line:84%
Raj. Raj.

02:35:26.272 --> 02:35:29.639 align:middle line:90%
This is the story of
Raj's life and crimes.

02:35:29.639 --> 02:35:35.692 align:middle line:90%
Now you know why and how
he took to crime.

02:35:35.692 --> 02:35:39.562 align:middle line:90%
My Lord, the one who is guilty
is his father...

02:35:39.562 --> 02:35:43.914 align:middle line:90%
..who drove an innocent woman from
his house, and denied his own son.

02:35:43.914 --> 02:35:46.438 align:middle line:90%
He is the one who forced them
to go begging from door to door.

02:35:46.438 --> 02:35:51.165 align:middle line:90%
And in the company of criminals,
he went astray.

02:35:51.165 --> 02:35:53.933 align:middle line:84%
My Lord and members of the Jury...

02:35:53.933 --> 02:35:56.410 align:middle line:90%
..if Raj is to be punished
for his crime..

02:35:56.410 --> 02:35:58.705 align:middle line:90%
..then his father should be
punished too.

02:35:58.705 --> 02:36:03.207 align:middle line:84%
My Lord, I would like to say something.

02:36:03.207 --> 02:36:09.304 align:middle line:90%
Emotion has got the better
of the counsel for defence.

02:36:09.304 --> 02:36:12.224 align:middle line:90%
In her anxiety to save the accused,
the counsel has presented...

02:36:12.224 --> 02:36:18.218 align:middle line:90%
..an interesting story,
however incongruous it might be...

02:36:18.218 --> 02:36:23.610 align:middle line:90%
..to try and prove that
some criminal happens to be my son!

02:36:23.610 --> 02:36:28.914 align:middle line:90%
But I ask, what evidence
does the counsel have?

02:36:28.914 --> 02:36:32.183 align:middle line:90%
No evidence on earth will convince you
that Raj is your son...

02:36:32.183 --> 02:36:35.509 align:middle line:90%
..not unless you are willing
to accept him as your son.

02:36:35.509 --> 02:36:40.980 align:middle line:90%
If there be proof, it lies deep
in your heart and in Raj's eyes.

02:36:40.980 --> 02:36:45.743 align:middle line:90%
Look at him. The same eyes,
the same high brow.

02:36:45.743 --> 02:36:49.942 align:middle line:90%
He even speaks like you speak.
He's just as adamant as you are.

02:36:49.942 --> 02:36:52.571 align:middle line:90%
Are you still not willing
to accept him as your son?

02:36:52.571 --> 02:36:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Ms Rita, the law heeds no emotion.

02:36:56.170 --> 02:37:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Nor my Lord, does the heart
heed any law.

02:37:01.330 --> 02:37:06.453 align:middle line:84%
I have no more to say.

02:37:06.453 --> 02:37:19.400 align:middle line:90%
If the accused has anything to say
in his defence, he may proceed.

02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:26.734 align:middle line:90%
Yes. At last,
after being branded a murderer...

02:37:26.734 --> 02:37:30.498 align:middle line:84%
..I hold your attention.

02:37:30.498 --> 02:37:37.671 align:middle line:90%
Had I been heard earlier, perhaps
I would never have had to stand here.

02:37:37.671 --> 02:37:40.895 align:middle line:90%
Ms Rita has tried her best
to save me from being hanged.

02:37:40.895 --> 02:37:44.115 align:middle line:90%
And not only in this particular case;
in my personal life too.

02:37:44.115 --> 02:37:49.627 align:middle line:90%
In my defence, I wish to say nothing.
I am evil.

02:37:49.627 --> 02:37:51.886 align:middle line:90%
I've been a vagabond ever since
I was a child.

02:37:51.886 --> 02:37:55.341 align:middle line:84%
I'm a murderer, a criminal.

02:37:55.341 --> 02:38:00.288 align:middle line:90%
You may punish me as you please.
But sin, crime, hatred and violence...

02:38:00.288 --> 02:38:03.486 align:middle line:90%
..this vicious circle that holds
your society in a vice-grip...

02:38:03.486 --> 02:38:06.607 align:middle line:90%
..do you think it can be broken
by hanging me?

02:38:06.607 --> 02:38:09.585 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to tell you
the story of my life.

02:38:09.585 --> 02:38:17.664 align:middle line:90%
But all I want to say is, I did not
inherit crime from my parents.

02:38:17.664 --> 02:38:19.735 align:middle line:90%
From that gutter full of filth
that flows beside my shanty...

02:38:19.735 --> 02:38:26.132 align:middle line:90%
...I picked up crime. That gutter
is still flowing over.

02:38:26.132 --> 02:38:31.207 align:middle line:84%
And the virus still breeds.

02:38:31.207 --> 02:38:35.173 align:middle line:90%
And countless children who live
in those slums...

02:38:35.173 --> 02:38:37.973 align:middle line:90%
..are falling prey to the virus
every day.

02:38:37.973 --> 02:38:45.275 align:middle line:90%
Do not think of me. Those children
are the ones you must care for.

02:38:45.275 --> 02:38:48.706 align:middle line:84%
You must care for your children.

02:38:48.706 --> 02:38:53.283 align:middle line:90%
Lest come the day when...
yours...

02:38:53.283 --> 02:38:54.955 align:middle line:84%
..and yours...

02:38:54.955 --> 02:38:58.656 align:middle line:84%
..and yours...

02:38:58.656 --> 02:39:00.801 align:middle line:90%
..and your son too stands
in these docks to reiterate...

02:39:00.801 --> 02:39:05.636 align:middle line:90%
..that it's an honest father's blood
that flows in my veins.

02:39:05.636 --> 02:39:10.839 align:middle line:90%
Time was when I was an innocent boy,
just like your sons.

02:39:10.839 --> 02:39:16.865 align:middle line:90%
Like all mothers, my mother too
wove a golden dream for me.

02:39:16.865 --> 02:39:21.699 align:middle line:90%
She would say, "My son will grow up
to become a lawyer".

02:39:21.699 --> 02:39:30.207 align:middle line:90%
Then he will become a magistrate.
And then, a judge... like his father.

02:39:30.207 --> 02:39:33.702 align:middle line:90%
I know the verdict that this court
is about to give.

02:39:33.702 --> 02:39:41.614 align:middle line:90%
And I'm willing to suffer any sentence.
For my sins, this is atonement.

02:39:41.614 --> 02:39:45.595 align:middle line:90%
But I await the decision
from yet another quarter.

02:39:45.595 --> 02:39:52.439 align:middle line:90%
I want to know Judge Raghunath,
what says your heart?

02:39:52.439 --> 02:40:19.741 align:middle line:84%
What says your heart?

02:40:19.741 --> 02:41:07.762 align:middle line:84%
Raj!

02:41:07.762 --> 02:41:13.295 align:middle line:84%
Has the Judge come to see his convict?

02:41:13.295 --> 02:41:17.169 align:middle line:84%
A father...

02:41:17.169 --> 02:41:20.121 align:middle line:84%
..who is guilty.

02:41:20.121 --> 02:41:21.778 align:middle line:84%
Guilty? You?

02:41:21.778 --> 02:41:24.385 align:middle line:84%
Yes.

02:41:24.385 --> 02:41:29.417 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow, the law might
pronounce you guilty.

02:41:29.417 --> 02:41:36.996 align:middle line:90%
But in the eyes of God,
I am the one who is guilty.

02:41:36.996 --> 02:41:39.138 align:middle line:84%
Are you weeping?

02:41:39.138 --> 02:41:45.834 align:middle line:90%
Yes, for the father who found his son,
and yet he has lost him.

02:41:45.834 --> 02:41:47.656 align:middle line:90%
For the husband who forced his wife
to become a widow.

02:41:47.656 --> 02:41:50.889 align:middle line:90%
For society, where poverty
breeds crime.

02:41:50.889 --> 02:41:52.933 align:middle line:90%
For the son who is orphaned
though his father is alive.

02:41:52.933 --> 02:41:54.823 align:middle line:90%
For the child who goes through life
looking for someone...

02:41:54.823 --> 02:41:56.651 align:middle line:84%
..who will call him "Son".

02:41:56.651 --> 02:42:00.864 align:middle line:84%
Son.

02:42:00.864 --> 02:42:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Son!

02:42:06.330 --> 02:42:40.305 align:middle line:84%
Son!

02:42:40.305 --> 02:42:45.581 align:middle line:90%
Raj, son of Judge Raghunath,
you have been proved guilty...

02:42:45.581 --> 02:42:48.994 align:middle line:90%
..of tying to assassinate
your father, Judge Raghunath.

02:42:48.994 --> 02:42:53.558 align:middle line:90%
But in the light of the strange and
unfortunate circumstances your life...

02:42:53.558 --> 02:42:57.724 align:middle line:90%
..which your counsel Ms Rita
has presented...

02:42:57.724 --> 02:43:39.772 align:middle line:90%
..you are sentenced to only three years
of rigorous imprisonment.

02:43:39.772 --> 02:43:41.526 align:middle line:84%
Crying?

02:43:41.526 --> 02:43:43.579 align:middle line:84%
You silly girl.

02:43:43.579 --> 02:43:46.474 align:middle line:84%
Silly, lawyers never cry.

02:43:46.474 --> 02:43:48.721 align:middle line:90%
At this rate, how are you
going to practice?

02:43:48.721 --> 02:43:56.677 align:middle line:90%
What use is the practice, Raj?
I wasn't able to save you.

02:43:56.677 --> 02:44:02.406 align:middle line:90%
No Rita, this penance
is very important for me.

02:44:02.406 --> 02:44:07.966 align:middle line:90%
Only after I've been through this,
will I be worthy of you.

02:44:07.966 --> 02:44:13.141 align:middle line:90%
With you beside me,
I can go through anything.

02:44:13.141 --> 02:44:16.336 align:middle line:84%
I will become an honest man.

02:44:16.336 --> 02:44:19.848 align:middle line:84%
Everyone will say I'm a good man.

02:44:19.848 --> 02:44:24.394 align:middle line:84%
I will read, I will write.

02:44:24.394 --> 02:44:28.770 align:middle line:90%
And just like Ma used to say,
first I'll become a lawyer...

02:44:28.770 --> 02:44:33.881 align:middle line:84%
..then a magistrate.

02:44:33.881 --> 02:44:37.673 align:middle line:84%
And then, a judge.

02:44:37.673 --> 02:44:45.908 align:middle line:90%
Last night I saw a judge.
And I liked him.

02:44:45.908 --> 02:44:49.181 align:middle line:84%
I'll become a judge.

02:44:49.181 --> 02:44:51.702 align:middle line:90%
You won't call me a savage anymore,
will you?

02:44:51.702 --> 02:44:59.756 align:middle line:84%
I will. You savage!

02:44:59.756 --> 02:45:02.399 align:middle line:84%
Time up.

02:45:02.399 --> 02:45:18.927 align:middle line:84%
Come on.

02:45:18.927 --> 02:45:21.376 align:middle line:84%
Keep this.

02:45:21.376 --> 02:45:25.856 align:middle line:84%
It's your gift.

02:45:25.856 --> 02:45:28.769 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry. I didn't steal it.

02:45:28.769 --> 02:45:31.386 align:middle line:84%
I just smuggled it in.

02:45:31.386 --> 02:45:45.937 align:middle line:84%
Raj.

02:45:45.937 --> 02:45:53.424 align:middle line:90%
Not your fault, Rita.
It's just the way I look.

02:45:53.424 --> 02:45:55.134 align:middle line:84%
Raj.

02:45:55.134 --> 02:45:58.105 align:middle line:84%
Raj.

02:45:58.105 --> 02:46:04.798 align:middle line:90%
Three years isn't too long, Raj.
I'll wait for you.

02:46:04.798 --> 02:46:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Rita.

02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:14.933 align:middle line:90%
I'll wait for you!
- Don't cry.

02:46:14.933 --> 02:46:23.414 align:middle line:84%
Number 308... move it.

02:46:23.414 --> 02:46:42.161 align:middle line:84%
I should be.

02:46:42.161 --> 02:46:45.733 align:middle line:90%
"I'm not flourishing,
I am not ruined."

02:46:45.733 --> 02:46:47.981 align:middle line:84%
"Still I sing happy songs."

02:46:47.981 --> 02:46:52.968 align:middle line:84%
"Still I sing happy songs."

02:46:52.968 --> 02:46:55.865 align:middle line:84%
"My heart is filled with wounds."

02:46:55.865 --> 02:47:01.118 align:middle line:84%
"But still these lively eyes smile."

02:47:01.118 --> 02:47:06.916 align:middle line:84%
"World.."

02:47:06.916 --> 02:47:18.492 align:middle line:90%
"World, I am troubled by your
sorrows or misfortunes."

02:47:18.492 --> 02:47:23.610 align:middle line:84%
"I am a vagabond."
