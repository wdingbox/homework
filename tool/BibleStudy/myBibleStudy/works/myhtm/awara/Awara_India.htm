				Awara(1951) (Tramp)</h1>
			<p>
				-- A Movie Review from a Christian Perspective</p>
			<a> 2016/05/04 W.D. </a>
			<p>
				There are many adolescence around us both in church, fellowship, Uah, or in my family. They are in a special important period in their whole life - facing the choice of believe/marriage. How could we help young generation is a tough issue in today&#39;s society. Reviewing my personal experiences before and after Christian, I found many insight from an old movie Awara(Tramp), and want to recommend and share with our today&#39;s young generation.</p>

				The movie contains two parts: 1) thoughts 2) love</p>
			<h2>
				Part One: About Guilt By Association In Genealogy:(血缘牽連)</h2>
			<h3>
				1.1 Defination</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Guilt by association(牽連): guilt ascribed to someone not because of any evidence but because of their association with an offender.</li>
                <li>
					Guilt by association in Genealogy(血缘牽連): guilt by association due to its genealogical relationship. (common in eastern culture) </li>
				<li>
					Guilt by association is one type of an Association Fallacy, which is an inductive informal fallacy of the type hasty generalization or red herring which asserts that qualities of one thing are inherently qualities of another, merely by an irrelevant association, and can be based on an appeal to emotion. (Red herring is a kind of fallacy that is an irrelevant topic introduced in an argument to divert the attention of listeners or readers from the original issue. In literature, this fallacy is often used in detective or suspense novels to mislead readers or characters or to induce them to make false conclusions.)<br>  
                    The two types are sometimes referred to as <ol><li>guilt by association</li><li> honor by association.</li></ol>
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                
                </li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				&nbsp;</p>
			In OT,
			<ol>
				<li>
					After Adam and Eve commit sin, all of his descents, including us for today, are all sinners. (Is this the guilt by association in genealogy?) </li>
				<li>
					In OT times,&nbsp;Exo 20:5 ...恨我的、我必追讨他的罪、自父及子、直到三四代． Exo 20:6 爱我守我诫命的、我必向他们发慈爱、直到千代。<br />
					Due 5:9 不可跪拜那些像、也不可事奉他、因为我耶和华你的　神、是忌邪的　神、恨我的、我必追讨他的罪、自父及子、直到三四代．5:10 爱我守我诫命的、我必向他们发慈爱直到千代、</li>
                <li>
                    Due24:16 不可因子杀父、也不可因父杀子．凡被杀的都为本身的罪。Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.</li>

			</ol>
            
<p>
				In NT, Since Jesus came into world, this law along with all other legacy laws has significant changed.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Mat5:17 莫想我来要废掉律法和先知．我来不是要废掉、乃是要成全。</li>
				<li>
					Mat22:37 耶稣对他说、你要尽心、尽性、尽意、爱主你的　神。 22:38 这是诫命中的第一、且是最大的。 22:39 其次也相仿、就是要爱人如己。 22:40 这两条诫命、是律法和先知一切道理的总纲。</li>
				<li>
					2Co 5:17 若有人在基督里、他就是新造的人．旧事已过、都变成新的了。</li>

				<li>
					Rome 1:3 论到他儿子我主耶稣基督．按肉体说、是从大卫后裔生的、</li>
				<li>
					Rome 1:4 按圣善的灵说、因从死里复活、以大能显明是　神的儿子。</li>
				<li>
					Mat 12:48 他却回答那人说、谁是我的母亲．谁是我的弟兄。 Mat 12:49 就伸手指着门徒说、看哪、我的母亲、我的弟兄。12:50 凡遵行我天父旨意的人、就是我的弟兄姐妹和母亲了。</li>
			
            
            
            
                 <li>
                    Act 16:31 他们说、当信主耶稣、你和你一家都必得救 They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved -- you and your household." (Is this the honor by association in genealogy?)</li>                                        
				
		
        
          
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            </ol>
            <p>
					In NT,&nbsp;genealogy principle was used to&nbsp;introduce&nbsp;Jesus in beginning of&nbsp;Mathew. It told us that Jesus was the offspring of good man.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				Mary or Joseph were not the strict biological offspring of Abraham. Mary/Joseph family member are not saved due to genealogy relationship but by faith.
                Jesus actually was the offspring of from Abraham in faith family. (In Mat1:1-19 and Luk 3) From these we can find that each person has two kinds of family trees:&nbsp;</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					biology family tree, connected through bio-father(not selectable)</li>
				<li>
					faith family tree, connected through heavenly father(selectable)</li>
                
			</ol>            
            
            
            
			In China cultrue,
			<ol>
				<li>
					中國古代社會實行殘酷的株連法(Implication law)，一人犯法，往往要被滅&ldquo;九族&rdquo;，即&ldquo;株連九族&rdquo;。《論衡 - Lunheng》[Eastern Han] 80 AD, Wang Chong;《傳》語曰：「町町若荊軻之閭。」言荊軻為燕太子丹刺秦王，後<a href="img/9_gens.jpg" target="blank">誅軻九族</a>，其後恚恨不已，復夷軻之一里。一里皆滅，故曰町町。</li>
				<li>
					父債子還:父亲生前的债务，由子女负责偿还。也指父辈的过错累及子女。<br />
					<br />
					在中国，&ldquo;欠债还钱&rdquo;、&ldquo;父债子还&rdquo;是延续了数千年,天經地義的传统观念。从情法通融的角度出发，继承法还规定了被继承人生前所欠债务超出遗产价值部分，继承人自愿偿还的，不在此限。而法律所指的继承人不仅仅是子女，还包括了其他继承人。对于大部分用于家庭生活开支等特殊债务，法律还有一些以家庭共同财产偿还的特殊规定。<br />
					<br />
					实际生活中，有不少子女自愿替父还债，作为一种优良传统，这种类型的&ldquo;父债子还&rdquo;应予支持、提倡。<br />
					<br />
					按照现代西方的法学理论，父与子是两个独立的民事主体，不因血缘关系的存在而混同，父债与其子无关。按照我国继承法的有关规定，继承遗产应偿还被继承人生前所欠债务，但应以遗产实际价值为限，超出部分，继承人不负偿还义务。从这个意义上说，&ldquo;父债子还&rdquo;在法律上是没有依据的。<br />
					<br />
					父債子還、祖債孫還，果真天經地義？ 在輿論與弱勢團體的殷切期盼下，立法院去（96）年12月14日終於三讀通過「民法繼承編部分修正條文」及其相關的執行法修正 限定繼承溯往 ...<br />
					<br />
					2009年05月14日 《民法》修正初審通過. 18萬背債兒受惠<a href="http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20090514/31627067/">【綜合報導】</a> 「父債子還」惡法將走入歷史！立法院司法及法制委員會昨初審通過《民法》繼承編及部分條文修正草案，將民眾繼承遺產改採「全面限定繼承」，意即如果繼承的債務大於所得遺產，僅須針對所得遺產負清償責任，不須如以往得還全部債務。由於新法擴及成年「背債兒」，法務部常務次長吳陳鐶估計，若經立院三讀通過，將有18萬3千多個案受惠。<br />
					國民黨立委呂學樟解釋，未來繼承債務以繼承所得遺產為限，例如獲200萬元遺產，但父母留下500萬元債務，只要還200萬元即可。 過去《民法》採「概括繼承」，意即繼承人無論財產、債務，得全部繼承，前年底修法時，修成免除未成年和禁治產者背負債務的「部分限定繼承」，這次修法則修成包括免除成年人債務的「全面限定繼承」。</li>
				<li>
					有其父必有其子</li>
				<li>
					一人得道 雞犬升天。 比喻一个人做了官，和他有关系的人也都跟着得势。现在也含有贬义的意思，暗指裙带关系。</li>
	
				<li>
					Today, some family still keep genealogy.</li>				
				<li>
					During CR(1965-1975), we judge a person based on his parents. In order to be a party member, three generations will be examined.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>
					I&#39;m victim of genealogy asscociation fallacy.</li>
				<li>
					Today, when choosing friends for children, we still care about their parents and family.</li>
				<li>
					In our Chinese church, the situation is a much better. But we still&nbsp;have&nbsp;similar perjure. For example, when introduce the new comers, we always ask what is your name, then followed by: &quot;where do you come from?&quot; or &quot;Where do you graduated?&quot;, or &quot;What is your career?&quot; etc. Nobody ask &quot;when did you baptized?&quot;</li>
			</ol>
            
            
            
			
			<p>
					Today, we are in church, in one big family, this is based on spiritual faith family.
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				By being nailed on cross, Jesus changed all brutal laws. Since then, whether a person is good or bad, is judged by his present heart, not by his past belief or behaviors, nor by any other things associated, like genealogy, social class, education, title, nor the past behaviors or your past life, etc. It is only determined by your heart right now.</p>
			<p>
				There is no much issues in western Christian countries in history. However, many scholars visit or study in western world, but they still not able to accept Jesus. Even nearly 2000 years has passed, for those that is none-Christian country(like China, Hindu, Thailand, Nepal, etc), this is still a specious(似是而非) issue, and made lot of troubles in their life. For example, in China,</p>

			<p>
				Although being after colonized by western for nearly 500 hundreds, India still kept Hinduism as their major faith. (Hinduism 80%, Islam 14%,Christian 2%,Buddasim 0.2%). The film we discussed today is about to expose the issues of implication existed in Hindu in early 20 century.</p>
			<h3>
				1.2 Plot </h3>
			<p>
				<a href="#Ragoonath_clip" name="Ragoonath_txt">Ragoonath </a> is a wealthy noble district judge.<br />
				The judge has a doctrine that &quot;good people are born to good people, and criminals are born to criminals.&quot;<br />
				When he analyze criminals, he always ask their <a href="#questioned_Raj_in_home_clip" name="questioned_Raj_in_home_txt">father&#39;s name.</a><br />
				<br />
				Once judge convicts定罪 Jagga into prison only because his father was a criminal.<br />
				After released, Jagga becomes a real criminal.<br />
				For revenge, Jagga first <a href="#kidnaps">kidnaps绑架</a> the judge&#39;s wife Leela after Raghunath&#39;s <a href="#honey_moon_clip">honey moon</a>.<br />
				After she was released, Jagga spread rumors everywhere.<br />
				Then the judge begins to suspect that Leela was unfaithful to him due to Jagga, and finally he decides to <a href="#drive_her_out_clip">drive her out</a> of the house right on the day of her labor.<br />
				<br />
				So Raj was born on street in poverty being estranged from the father.<br />
				When Raj is a teenager, Jagga begins to <a href="#to_be_thief" name="to_be_thief_txt">allure him to be thief.</a><br />
				After Raj is released from prison after 12 years, he <a href="#take_father_as_thief_clip" name="take_father_as_thief_txt">take thief as father</a> and become a <a href="#awara_clip" name="awara_txt">awara</a>, trump, the name of the film.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				view clips</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				So far, we can see Jagga&#39;s successfully completed his long term revenge plan finally.<br />
				This story is a tragedy:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Jagga - innocent. He was killed by Raj.</li>
				<li>
					Judge&#39;s wife - revenge on innocent, endure miserable injustice pain. died of car accidence.</li>
				<li>
					Raj - child victim. Rag is face sentence to death or life prison</li>
				<li>
					The judge himself break his own happy family.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				The direct reason to produce such tragedy seems to be due to judge&#39;s doctrine - &quot;the son of good is good, the son of thief is thief&quot;. Ragoona believe Rama god - the seventh god in Hindu religion. Actually, it is such kind of heresy believe that force Ragoona to drive out his wife.</p>

				The fate of judge&#39;s wife is a little similar to Xiang LingSao in China -- they all are the victim of the heresies. The wrong believe is the root reason for the tragedy. The real murder is the heresies. the evil, the snake.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				This story, from a negative viewpoint, in a vivid style, with a tragedy, demonstrated a positive abstractive blessing theory about the righteousness articulated in Roma. that is,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Justification by Faith(因信稱義)<br />
					To judge a person whether he is good or bad is not by his appearance action, but by his faith.<br />
					Ragoona is not righteous, even he is a judge in court, professor in law school. He creates criminals, he is a criminal that need to be sentenced.
					<p>
						Jesus said: Those who believe in me, my heavenly father recognize him; those who deny me, my heavenly father deny him.</p>
					<p>
						Those who deny Jesus as savor, seek his own way, can only end with tragedy.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					fulfill justice by Faith. (因信成義)<br />
					Any one, no matter how strong you are to insist the righteousness, you can not win to be the righteous without putting your faith on Jesus. Ragoona is strong in court, education, but he is weak, crude, murder as husband in family.</li>
				<li>
					Live by Faith (因信得生)<br />
					We can only get eternal life through believe HIM. We can not change our biological family tree. But we can freely change spiritual family tree. When our spirit family tree was connected to the eternal GOD, then we become eternal.</li>

				Part Two: About Love</h2>
			<h3>
				2.1 About Types of Love</h3>
			<a href="http://totescute.com/four-types-of-love-greek-style/">The Four Types of Love in Greek Style </a>
			<ol>
				<li>
					AGAPE : This is a special term which represents the divine-love of the Lord towards his Son Jesus Christ, the human beings and all believers. This is the best of the three types of love in the bible, in fact Jesus himself showed this type of divine love to his Dad in heaven and humanity. Agape love is the love that God commanded all believers to have for everyone whether he/she is a believer or not. Agape love should never be determined by our feelings; it is more of a set of behaviors or actions. With agape, you do not have to actually feel it for you to give it, which means that you can be able to show love without feeling anything at all. At times feelings can follow after showing this kind of love.</li>
				<li>
					PHILEO : The phileo love refers to an affectionate(亲热), warm and tender platonic(柏拉图式的) love. It makes you desire friendship with someone. It&rsquo;s the kind of love which livens up the Agape love. Although you may have an agape love for your enemies, you may not have a phileo love for the same people. The translation of the word phileo is love in the noun &ndash; form: it is how you feel about someone. It is a committed and chosen love. This is a unique kind of love like the one you have for a companion or pal. It refers to loving one another just like your brother or sister. This love is for a pal who is really close and dear to us and it is characterized by various different shared experiences between two people. In fact this is the kind of love that many Christians tend to practice towards one another. And although philos love is really wonderful, it is not that much reliable, since it can end up souring at times as we have all experienced at some point in our lives.</li>
				<li>
					STORGE : This is a special term which represents the divine-love of the Lord towards his Son Jesus Christ, the human beings and all believers. This is the best of the three types of love in the bible, in fact Jesus himself showed this type of divine love to his Dad in heaven and humanity. Agape love is the love that God commanded all believers to have for everyone whether he/she is a believer or not. Agape love should never be determined by our feelings; it is more of a set of behaviors or actions. With agape, you do not have to actually feel it for you to give it, which means that you can be able to show love without feeling anything at all. At times feelings can follow after showing this kind of love.</li>
				<li>
					EROS : Eros is a Greek term which actually means desire and longing. And according to the Greek methodology, Eros is the name of the Greek god of love. Also referred to as erotic love, this is a selfish kind of love as it associated with sexual love. Eros love is based on the strong feeling we have against one another and it usually develops during the 1st stage of a romantic relationship. This kind of love is based on the physical traits. And unless it is redeemed by the Lord&rsquo;s presence; this type of love can end up being possessive, since it always seeks to 1st conquer and then control. God created physical attraction between a man &amp; a woman, but He never intended for it to be selfish. He created desire and longing which makes up sexual love which is crucial in any marriage. This love was meant to be preserved between a couple and it is essential for any health marriage. And since it is mostly based on self-benefit, many people tend to fall out of love if they are not happy with the marriage.</li>
			</ol>
			This just offers you a general understanding and description of the four types of love which promotes a good, healthy and progressive relationship. In any relationship, you should have all these four loves working together to enable it survive for a longer time. But in some cases, a relationship may be long-lasting if partners share the same style of love.

			<h3>
				2.2 Plot Introduction</h3>
			<p>
				The most complicated story is nearly finished. If judge is a Christian and had studied Bible, he could avoid such kind of mistakes.<br />
				But things has happened, who can save this tragedy? is it the court? is it the laws? the knife/weapons? the knowledge? music? prophecies? mighty? religions? none of them, but the love which implanted in our heart by GOD.</p>
			<p>
				Raj had a little friends called Rita. but they lost connection soon.<br />
				Rita&#39;s father died early, she was raised by his father&#39;s friends Ragoona and also study laws.<br />
				After they grow up, Rita became lawyer, Raj became a tramp, thief, robbery.<br />
				One day, purchased from policeman, Raj escaped into Rita&#39;s house in accidence.<br />
				When they recognized each other, Rita began to fall in love of Raj.</p>
                
                
                
			<h3>
				2.3 Types of Loves Presented From Rita In Movie.</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					the beaten love (被殴打的愛): After Rita accidentally offended Raj and was beaten, what did she response? What kind of love it looks like?
                    <p>你要打，你就打吧。 (willingly,not angerily)</p>
					<div>
						<p>
							Luk 6:29 有人打你这边的脸、连那边的脸也由他打．有人夺你的外衣、连里衣也由他拿去。<br />
							Mat 5:39 只是我告诉你们、不要与恶人作对．有人打你的右脸、连左脸也转过来由他打。</p>
						<p>
							When people has true love, it is natural to do so.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>
							Love is Jesus - sacrifice on cross - Jesus said to all of us: if you want to betray/beat/kill me, then go ahead.<br />
							Jhn 13:27 他吃了以后、撒但就入了他的心。耶稣便对他说、你所作的快作吧。</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					the blind love (無知的愛): Raj want to tell Rita that he is a thief/robbery. But what did Rita want to know? What kind of love it looks like?
                    <div><ol><li>
你 現在 還不完全了解我，
我 做什麼，是個什麼人，
我的生活，我的家庭，
你什麼都不知道。
</li><li>
我什麼都不想知道，
我就知道你就是你，
我愛你。</li></ol>
                    </div>
                    <p>The more we know, the less we love.</p>
                    <p>The more we know, the more attemption we have.</p>
					<div>
						Love is <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/love-always-trusts.html">always trusts</a> 凡事相信 love=trust, trust=love<br />
						<p>
							Love do&nbsp;not need know your background - education degree, professional career, criminal records, family, rich, social class, where about, etc. &quot;I do not want to know anything, You are what you are. I only know I love you.&quot;<br />
							It doesn&#39;t matter you are white, black or yellow, healthy or disabled, as long as you are the man made in GOD, we should love.</p>
						<p>
							Love always trusts you are Good man, my beloved, best of best. You can do it. Do not trust rumor, gossips, indictment, judgment. There is no second-guessing or questioning of whether the person should be loved. Love is simply given. It is unconditional. The loved one does not need to perform anything or achieve a certain goal in order to be loved. Just as Christ loves His children unconditionally, He calls us to love others. Love is based on who He is, not on what others associated.</p>
						<p>
							That is, he will not be suspicious of the one he loves. He will be slow to believe any damaging news concerning the loved one and will always give the benefit of the doubt. Whatever the situation, love is ready to trust. To trust someone means that you are &ldquo;ever ready to believe the best&rdquo;  of him or her. The loved one may have a checkered past or be in some other way undeserving of trust, yet true love is able to overlook past that cannot meet the need of the individual. Mistrust, cageyness, and suspicion are at odds with godly love.</p>
						<p>
							Only when our focus is on Christ, we can show His love to meet the needs of others, to believe in one another, setting suspicion aside and extending unconditional love. </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					the uneasily-angered love (不轻易发怒的愛): When Rita finally realized she was cheated and betrayed, how did she response? What kind of love it looks like?
					<div>
						<p>
							it is not easily angered, 不輕易發怒</p>
                        <p>
						when all trust was broken, when facing the fact of lying, when the heart is broken, The true love is still patient. Love uses the tears to replace the revenge, the wounds.</p>
                        
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					the unfailed love (忠貞不渝的愛):After Raj felt shamed and down about himself, what did she do? What kind of love it looks like?
                    <ol>
                    <li>
現在你該了解我了吧。我是個賊，我是個底下的流浪漢。你打算怎麼辦吧。
</li><li>
你不要誤會我的意思，我還和從前一樣愛你。 
</li><li>
你是個高貴的小姐，富貴人家長大的，
我是在監獄裡長大的。
我們不是一樣的人，你怎麼會愛我。
</li><li>

這些都是可以改變的，只要你肯改過，我可以幫助你。你必須開始新的生活。這完全看你肯不肯下決心。
</li><li>
不，現在說什麼也都晚了。過去的一切，我怎麼能忘掉？我受到的侮辱，賞到的痛苦，想起來太可怕，你能了解嗎？我沒有父親，甚至，連他叫甚麼名字，我都不知道。就為這個，我一生就成為罪人。我這一生完了。
一切都完了。我有什麼辦法。我們該分手了。我該走另一條路。我是不值得你愛的人。你把我忘掉吧。

</li><li>

我認為你是個剛強的人，你应该拿出勇氣來，從新做人吧。

</li><li>

我是想從新做人。但生活總是逼我往老路上走。就因為我做過賊，工廠把我趕出來，不要我。我一個人，有什末辦法。
</li><li>
你不是一個人，有你母親和我， 幫助你。

</li><li>
你幫助我，幫助流浪漢？
</li><li>
是，我永遠和你在一起。你是我的，不管誰說什麼，我也是愛你，這就是我的心裡話，現在該信我了吧。
</li><li>


可是你忘了，我有個壞名譽。
</li><li>
我幫助你洗掉這個壞名譽。我們走吧。

                    
                    </li>
                    </ol>

				</li>
				<li>
					the brave love (勇敢的愛): When Raj was captured and judged in court, what did she do? What kind of love it looks like?
                    <ol>
                    <li>这个案件是关系到我的生命问题</li>

                    <li>那么,良心也不承认法律。</li>
                    </ol>
                    
					<div>
						<p>

			<p>
				No matter how perfect the actress perform, its love is still limited if we compare it with Jesus super love. However, she performed better than what ordinary people did in our daily life.</p>
            <p>
				John Bapatized said: Jhn 3:29 娶新妇的、就是新郎．新郎的朋友站着听见新郎的声音就甚喜乐．故此我这喜乐满足了。The relationship between Jesus and us is a little similar to the relationship of our early love affairs. Some of the noble characteristics can be mirrored in our human pure love affairs.</p>         
			<p>
				All of us desire to be loved or love like Jesus, which is not based upon color, looking, degree, class, fames, past records, etc. We want to be generous, forgiving, and compassionate enough to love people unconditionally. But no matter how hard we try, somehow we fall short. Our humanness always gets in the way. Even in pure virtual movie, with best wishes in our imagination, our love is still limited. Never to say in the real life. We cannot to be perfect, we can only trust Jesus. Only through HIM, we can become perfect and satified. <a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/topicaldevotions/a/Love-Like-Jesus.htm">...</a></p>

			<h3>
				3.2 Summary</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					From the view point of art, the movie successfully applied the dialog, folk music/dance, scenery, facial express, etc. into its performance, which involves believes, folks religion, laws, social issues, and open love story, etc. various areas. Especially it combined the two completely different but popular topics, genealogy thoughts and the love affairs, into one story so naturally and organically that it caused audians to response intensively.</li>
				<li>
					Since released in 1951, this film hit popular in China, Russia, and other none Christian countries. It effectively changed many, at least our generation&#39;s, traditional minds and significantly helped to end Culture Revolution in China. Today we seldom judge people by parents; people began to dare to express its love naturally.</li>
				<li>
					If we review this movie from biblical view points, we can find many vivid samples that could related to our today&#39;s bible study. For example, Ragoona represents the pharisees, the legalism(律法主義), its total failure in moral help us to understand &quot;justification by faith&quot; in Roma; The pure love that turns tragedy into comedy can help us to understand the importance of Jesus love over faith and hope in (1Col 13).</li>
				<li>
					The movie can help people to change the mind about the genealogy association fallacy from western culture. but it did not give people the root reason under the issues -- which is related to religions. Many eastern scholars graduated from western university only learned the advanced technologies, scientific theories, culture styles, social system, etc. They did not touch the core spirit inside of western culture -- they failed to help people to directly connect to Jesus. Even today many people who love this movie still refuse Gospels. So different kinds of new tragedy still kept following again and again. I am not sure if the authors/actors were Christian or not, at least, we could find that they were affected by early western culture and they pursued the true love. If we did not expose it, people may consider this movie as pleasure for entertainment.</li>
				<li>
					Our biological marriage contains private and jealous factors. But mutual sacrificed purely love and loyalty can raise us up to a level to represent our love to Jesus. The marriage can be the symbol (typology預表) of the testament relationship between GOD and us. Such kind of ideas could not be presented at all.</li>
				<li>
					The world is not the vain or meaningless like some religious said. The desire and pursue is not the root reason of bitterness, nor is the various world our ultimate goal. The critical point is what kind of desire and pursue it is? If our ultimate goal is to pursue unique truth, all things will be good, since all things that GOD created is good. Otherwise, the life become meaningless. Unfortunately, the movie can not express such ideology. More or less, the movie contains flesh desires. The perfect art could cause illusion to mislead many pagans/gentiles to fallen corruption(墮落腐化). But compared with today&#39;s most movies, this is much better.</li>
				<li>
					Through the film performance, we can see how great what the Lord created. Lord give all kind of passions and rich facial expression capability. He also plant his love in our heart. But these are used for HIM not for our private flesh desires.</li>
				<li>
					Probably, in our daily life, we can love a particular person as truly as Rita in movie - we do not care his past, his careers, we do not want know anything else, we simply love him, even he beat us, even we are betrayed. However, it is impossible for us to love everyone or even our enemies like that. But to love our neighbors as if love ourselves is what our heavenly father expected. To be able to do so, we have to turn our faith on Jesus.Untortunately, the movie can not imply it to audians through any art or skills.</li>
				<li>
					For today&#39;s young man, this movie is still worth to recommend. It can well mirror the struggles, agony(痛苦, 烦恼) and hopes existed in many young man or teenagers today. It&#39;s better if Christian parents can give them some guidance when they watch. At least, this movie encourage people to think deeper seriously, rather than pleasures. It may help young man to pursue the eternal pure love, righteousness and truth.</li>
 
				<li>
					DISCERNMENT WARNINGS FOR AUDIENCE: The folk music and the pictures that were pleasing to the ears and eyes may mislead people to fall in flesh desires from earth.</li>
