What is a Gospel?

1) gospel comes from Greek word euangelion, means "good news." It was used in ancient Greek for the announcement of military victories or other instances of good fortune. For example, the birthday of Caesar Augustus was described as "the beginning of his good messages" (gospel) (loc 190) in a book Aspien in 6 BC.

2) Paul contextualized "gospel" to the story about Jesus Christ. It was used in his earliest letter Galatian, and totally appeared about 70 times in Paul's epistles.  The word gospel was also used in the Four Books of the Gospels for about nine times. It refer to the life of Jesus, his teaching.

3) After the 2nd century, gospel began to be used to represent the four books of the Gospels in NT until today.
