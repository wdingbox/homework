<h4>
		Scientific Study vs Biblical Study</h4>
		<h5>Abstraction</h5>
		<p>
			Study plays important role for each person in our daily life. But many people do not realize that there are two different types of study that drive us into two different desitinations unconsciouly. This paper will look into this issue closely, make a distinguish between them namely scientifiy study (or regular study) and biblical study, and exame their relationship and effects for Christians life.
		</p>
		





		<h5>Definition of Scientific Study</h5>
		<p>
			The word 'study' is a middle English, shortening of Old French estudie (noun), estudier (verb), both based on Latin studium ‘look at closely' and 'zeal, painstaking (taking or characterized by taking pains or trouble) application.’ 
		</p>
		<p>
			The meaning of 'study' and 'research' are similar in that both are to spend effort to look at something closely to make it known clearly. The difference is that study is to acquire what is made known. Whereas research is to establish facts to reach new conclusions through systematic investigation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The English word "science" appeared in mid-14c, rooted from sci- (scissors), "cut, split, divide, seperate", implied "to distinguish true from false", denoted "what is known acquired by study", "assurance of knowledge, certitude, certainty", as "experiential knowledge;" From 17c.-18c. this concept commonly was used in philosophy. <!--Sense of "non-arts studies" is attested from 1670s.--> [<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/science">2</a>]
		</p>
		<p>
			In far east, the word "science" was first translated by Japanese as "科学" (literally means category knowledge) no later than 1864 in Early Meiji Dynasty(明治初年). In 1897, the same Japanese term began to spread widely in China after publish of the book, The Japanese Catagory Record(日本书目志), which was written by Chinese scholar Kang YouWei (康有为, 1858-1927).  
		</p>
		<p>
			The opposite of science is not anti-science but syncretism which means to amalgamate different categories together. In religion, syncretism means "reconciliation of different beliefs while blending practices of various schools of thought" 1610s, from French syncrétisme (17c.) and directly from Modern Latin syncretismus (used by German Protestant theologian David Pareus, 1615), from Greek synkretismos "union of communities," from synkretizein "to combine against a common enemy," from syn- "together" (see syn-) + second element of uncertain origin. One theory connects it with kretismos "lying," from kretizein "to lie like a Cretan;" another connects it with the stem of kerannynai "to mix, blend;" krasis "mixture." Related: Syncretist; syncretistic <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/syncretism">.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several discrete things. Syncretism is different from application in that syncretism makes things obscure and unclear about its orign--it make a thing looks like but is not. While application will always keep its original applied resources clear and unchanged. Syncretism contains secret stealing process. Application contains open buying process. So far, syncretism has no widely accepted Chinese translation. Today's Chinese culture is a syncretism of Daoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, materialism and Christianity.	
		</p>
		<p>
			The scientific study means to use the scientific method to conduct their study or research. The scientific method is a standardized way of making observations, gathering data, forming theories, testing predictions, and interpreting results. Three key elements are 1) evidence, 2) theory, and 3) application. 


			Application is to put the deducted theory into operation especially for some human practical purpose. In return, application can produce new evidence and inspire new ideas or theories. Hence, the scientific method is an endless recyclic process of evidencing, theorization and application.  Evidencing and theorization can be shortened as 'science'. The practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area is called 'technology'. science-and-technology. Application verifies theory and theory produces application. Science and technology depend on each other and form a holistic endless spiral exploratory process.

		</p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<h5>Definition of Biblical Study</h5>

		<p>
			The term 'biblical study' or 'biblical Christian' are new terms appeared recently in seminary school. The word 'biblical' means anything relating to, of, or being in accord with the Bible. The Bible is specifically refer to the sacred scriptures of Christians comprising 49 books of the Old Testament and 36 books of the New Testament. 
		</p>
		<p> 

			The word 'bible' comes from Anglo-Latin biblia in early 14c, rooted from biblio, a collection of books, papers or scrolls. []

			The Christian scripture was referred to in Greek as Ta Biblia as early as c. 223. Bible replaced Old English biblioðece (see bibliothec) as the ordinary word for "the Scriptures." Figurative sense of "any authoritative book" is from 1804. Bible-thumper "strict Christian" is from 1870. []

			<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/bible"></a>

		</p>
		<p>
			The term "biblical study" cannot be found in the Bible. The closest related phrase in NT appeared only once in NIV translated as "diligently study the Scriptures" (John 5:39) The concept of 'biblical study' may come from the Bible study of the fellowship group where some ordinary people gather together to study the Bible as a personal religious or spiritual practice in Christian communities. The term "biblical study" was coined to distinguish itself from regular study which is scientific study in the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Biblical study can be defined as the Christian's Bible study with the enhanced academic format. Academic format means a set of precise rules for education system. 
		</p>
		<p>
		    Biblical study primarily differs from the Christians' Bible study in that a) a Bible study occurs in a inner circle of a fellowship group, whereas, a biblical study or research mainly appears in public seminary college or institute. b) a Bible study is light in burden but thick in agape and prayer, biblical study endures pressures academically, financially, socially and spiritually. c) the Bible study seeks balanced spiritual growth in life, biblical study emphasizes on intellect which is the power of knowing as distinguished from the power to feel and to will. Overall, biblical study is not advanced level for Bible study and cannot replace the Bible study in fellowship group.  
		</p>

		<h5>Differences between Biblical Study and Scientific Study</h5>

		<p>
			Biblical study is subject to confuse with regular study in school which is essentially a scientific study. Both are the same as looking into closely, making things clear and acquiring knowledge consciously. Both types of study have learning and growing process which involves the evidencing, theorization and application. In seminary school, both are almost identical in forms of classes, lectures, academic evaluation system, and administration mechanism.    
		</p>
		<p>
			However, both types of study essentially differ to each other. First, the biblical study is driven under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Its motivation is to seek the eternal truth, the Word. Whereas scientific study is mainly driven by human desires. It has no clear consistant motivation, it could be driven by personal career or amateur, economic profit, any political or religious ideal and so on.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Second, biblical study has a clear missionary driven goal--to know Him and make Him known--to know Him in order to make Him known over the world. It is by knowing Him, each individual can better understand the specific mission that He assigned to him and to prepare to accomplish it. Scientific study may have a short-term goal mainly driven by the world.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Third, biblical study is up and down reciproral communication process between the world and the Heaven. Whereas scientific study involves in an endless  trial process between theory and application, science and technology. Biblical study has a terminal endpoint which is the Church where to worship HIM. It is an one-way ticket toward the eternal glorious kingdom of God. Although many believe that the endless process between science and technology is a spiral up evolutionary process, its ultimate end is a black hole.   
		</p>
		<p>
			Even though biblical study is similar to scientifc study in evidencing, theorization and application, essentially in detail they are completely different beings. First, biblical study does not rely on scientific evidence used in scientific study which focuses on the material world. Instead, biblical study primarily relies on biblical testimony. The word "testimony" means "evidence, statement of a witness" first recorded early 15c., from Old French testimonie (11c.), from Latin testimonium "evidence, proof, testimony," from testis "witness".  The words "testify" and "testimony" both derive from the Latin word testis, referring to the notion of a disinterested third-party witness. In Christians community, especially within the evangelical tradition, the term "to testify" or "to give one's testimony" is used to mean "to tell the story of how one became a Christian". Commonly it may refer to a specific event in a Christian's life in which they believe God did something deemed particularly worth sharing. Testify and test both are similar in role for evidencing proof. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The reason that biblical study does not rely on scientific evidence is not because that scientific evidence is not reliable, but because that it is merely based upon the repeatable experience or experiments within the limited material world. Many things are not repeatedly testable. Biblical testimony is always unreproducible, unique identical and often supernatural. Biblical testimony transcends the world of scientific evidence. Scientific evidence can be true and false, helpful and harmful for biblical study. Hence, scientific evidence at most can be used as a secondary evidence in biblical study.      
		</p>
		<p>
			Second, theorization in biblical study is always based on the biblical laws which are the commands of God. All theological argumentation principles are derived from the Scripture. In biblical study, there exists a terminal of the chains of reasoning--which is the command from God. Whereas in scientific study, the theorization is based upon some generally acknowledged natural axiom, the certainty of which depend on the endless testing.    
		</p>
		<p>
			Third, biblical study does not have application or technolgy that scientific study pursues. There is no such word or similar concept in the Bible. In biblical study, it is incorrect to try to think to apply biblical testimony or principles into your life like scientific study did, since the application is manipulated by man rather than God. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After the biblical testimony and theological principles are presented, what to do is to surrender and to obey God to let Him do whatever He wanted on personal life. "do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect" (Rom 12:2) It is to surrend to HIM that the new life can be born again to beocome a new witness that  testifies what is truth. 
		</p>
		<p>
			God can be testified but cannot be tested or applied."you should not put the Lord your God to the test" (Mat4:7) In biblical study, the goal is to seek obedience rather than application. 
		</p>


		<h5>Relationship between Biblical Study and Scientific Study</h5>


		<p>
			Scientific study is widely accepted by all people in the world. Scientific knowledge became the only common knowledge for all different cultures and religious people including Christianity. Science and technology is spiritual DMZ to reach the lost. 
		</p>
		<p>	 
			Scientific study plays dual roles in biblical study. 
			On the one hand, scientific study can help learners to better understand the Bible from a historical perspective in biblical study. For example, the unearthed archeological evidence and historical study or research can be used in biblical study. On the other hand, scientific study is subject to turn the learners to atheism or materialism. Most people use scientific study to gain a degree to find a job to earn money, to buy house to accumulate 401k for euthanasian death. Some people use scientific study to develop its religion to defense its belief.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is a trend in the world that the biblical study is being gradually downgraded and replaced by scientific study. For example, Columbia Bible School, which was founded in 1923 in Columbia, SC, was originated from a Bible study women fellowship group. In 1960, the name was changed to Columbia Bible College. In 1994, the name was changed again to Columbia International University. The change from Bible study, Bible school, Bible college, to international university, is not about the name but about the character, attitude and the way of study of the Bible--a sign from biblical study to scientific study. <a href="http://www.ciu.edu/about-ciu/facts-and-history">[]</a> 
		</p>

		<p>
			In biblical study, the biblical testimony or scientific evidence is not just about evidence. It is more about the knowledge to describe who He is. Jesus is the one who can turn water into wine and walk on water. From this perspective, both scientific evidence and biblical testimony do not conflict but compliment each other for better understanding the Word. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Neither biblical testimony nor scientific evidence are necessary and sufficient condition for Christian's faith. Most people believe Jesus through evidence like disciple Thomas. Many people do not believe in Jesus even with evidences, like Pharisees. Some people can believe Jesus without any evidence, like Simeon and Anna (Luke 2:25, 2:36). Jesus said "blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." (John 20:29)
		</p>
		<p>
   			Scientific study acquires scientific knowledge which is the native knowledge, biblical study acquires biblical knowledge which is foreign knowledge. But if the acquired knowledge comes from the papers or from classrooms, it still belongs to the earth and will pass away. John Baptism once said "A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven." (John 3:27) 
   		</p>
   		<p>
   			It is not true that "knowledge is power" regardless it is scientific or biblical. If the acquired knowledge could not be used to testify to Jesus, it is harmful to life. Jesus said "You search(study) the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me," (John 5:39)  Behold on Him. In general, biblical knowledge construct faith, scientific knowledge or other non-biblical knowledge decrease or destruct faith. "For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge the more grief" (Ecc 1:18). 
		</p>



   <h5>A Bible Scholar vs A Christian</h5>
   <div>
   	
   
   What is a Bible scholar?


<section class="contents">
Answer: </strong>
A scholar is someone who has done advanced study in a special field. Therefore, a Bible scholar would be a person who has done advanced studies in Bible, perhaps by going to <a href="what-is-a-seminary.html">seminary</a> or graduate school. Perhaps a “Bible scholar” would be differentiated from a pastor, as the pastor’s primary job is to shepherd the church whereas a “scholar” may work in isolation, writing and doing research. A “Bible scholar” may also be differentiated from a theologian in that a theologian is working to put together a comprehensive system of doctrine whereas a Bible scholar may be content to simply clarify what the Bible says without trying to systematize it. Seminaries today often have separate departments corresponding to the distinctions above. A seminary may have a “Pastoral Studies” department, a “Theological Studies” department, and a “Biblical Studies” department, among others.<br><br>
Having said that, there is no authoritative, technical standard for what it takes to be a Bible scholar. Some who have never been to seminary but have studied the Bible extensively and availed themselves of good resources may indeed be genuine Bible scholars—they are students of the Bible. Likewise, there need not be a sharp distinction between the various seminary departments mentioned above. We would hope that every pastor and theologian would also be a Bible scholar. One would also hope that every Bible scholar would be able to use the knowledge acquired to minister to people.<br><br>
Because of the wide variety of approaches to the Bible and the many attacks on the reliability of God’s Word today, it is often necessary to add an extra modifier to <i>Bible scholar</i>. Today, the church is served by many fine evangelical Bible scholars who believe that the Bible is God’s Word and seek to clarify the meaning of the Bible for the good of the church and to the glory of God. Unfortunately, there are many liberal Bible scholars, critical Bible scholars, and even skeptical Bible scholars who believe that the Bible holds no authority, being  merely a book of literature or a historical record of the religious experiences of people in the past. These scholars often put themselves in the position of judging the Bible rather than the other way around.<br><br>
It is interesting that the word <i>scholar</i> can also mean “student”—anyone who is studying at any level. Today, some schools in the United States refer to their students as “scholars”—even Kindergarteners. Using this definition, every Christian could and should be a “Bible scholar.” It is sad that much of the church today is biblically illiterate.<br><br>
Scripture teaches us the importance of studying what it has to say. This study is not limited to taking a class at a Bible college or seminary or even Sunday School. Christians are supposed to feed on God’s Word in whatever ways are available to them—reading, <a href="why-read-Bible.html">studying</a>, <a href="Bible-memorization.html">memorizing</a>, and <a href="Christian-meditation.html">meditating on the Word</a>; reading good books that help explain the Bible; attending church services where they can hear Bible preaching and teaching; listening to Christian radio; and, of course, utilizing good online tools like Got Questions.<br><br>
Below are just a few of the verses that speak of the importance of studying God’s Word and being a “Bible scholar”:<br><br>
“I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you” (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%20119.11" data-reference="Ps 119.11" data-version="esv" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank">Psalm 119:11</a>).<br><br>
“I meditate on your precepts and consider your ways. I delight in your decrees; I will not neglect your word” (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%20119.15%E2%80%9316" data-reference="Ps 119.15–16" data-version="esv" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank">Psalm 119:15–16</a>).<br><br>
“This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it” (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Josh%201.8" data-reference="Josh 1.8" data-version="esv" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank">Joshua 1:8</a>).<br><br>
“Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true” (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts%2017.11" data-reference="Acts 17.11" data-version="esv" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank">Acts 17:11</a>).<br><br>
“Every scripture is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the person dedicated to God may be capable and equipped for every good work” (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Tim%203.16%E2%80%9317" data-reference="2 Tim 3.16–17" data-version="esv" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:16–17</a>).<br><br>
“But he answered, ‘It is written, “Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God”’” (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%204.4" data-reference="Matt 4.4" data-version="esv" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank">Matthew 4:4</a>).<br><br>
“For whatever was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that we may have hope through endurance and through the encouragement from the Scriptures” (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%2015.4" data-reference="Rom 15.4" data-version="esv" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank">Romans 15:4</a>).<br><br>
There were a number of Bible scholars who interacted with Jesus on a regular basis. These scholars were called the <a href="scribes-and-Pharisees.html">scribes and Pharisees</a>. The scribes were professionals whose job it was to know the law of God and copy and interpret it for others. The Pharisees were a very strict sect of Judaism who made it their business to know and fastidiously keep all of the laws of God. However, simply knowing the facts of Scripture is not enough.<br><br>
Jesus warned, “You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life” (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%205.39%E2%80%9340" data-reference="John 5.39–40" data-version="esv" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank">John 5:39–40</a>). The scribes and the Pharisees studied the Scriptures, and that was a good thing. However, their focus became the book, the words, the body of literature. They thought that by knowing the Word of God they would gain eternal life. In their zeal for the Word of God, they missed God Himself. If they had really understood what they were studying, they would have come to Christ, because all Scripture points to Him and is fulfilled in Him. The scholars’ intellectual and legalistic pursuit of God’s Word had blinded them to the very subject that God’s Word attempted to illuminate.<br><br>
In the final analysis, there is no benefit to being a Bible scholar if the scholar does not submit to the authority of the Bible. There is no benefit to knowing God’s Word if one does not get to know God in the process. The Bible does not give us eternal life, but it points us to Jesus who does. It is difficult to understand who God is and the life that is available in Christ without making it a priority to study the Bible.<br><br>

	<h5>How to Study the Gospels</h5>
		<p>
			The Gospels provide seven different types of evidence to testify to Jesus: God, the Only Son of God, Holy Spirit, ancient prophets, OT, missionary works, and contemporary believers. This argumentation is typical clear in the gospel of John. 
			These seven evidence is perfect enough to show Jesus is the Son of God. However, mordern people always add the eighth evidence--scientific data.  
		</p>
		<p>
		    The fact that the mordern people use scientific method to study the Bible can only prove that mordern human mind has already been scientificated. One of the goals to study the Bible is to turn the scientific mind back to the biblical mind in order to repent to recieve the Holy Spirit to enter the kingdom of Heaven.  
		</p>

		<p>
			"If faith rests upon historical verification, it is no longer authentic faith but is reduced to good works — of the historian."

Ladd, George Eldon. A Theology of the New Testament (p. 177). Eerdmans Publishing Co - A. Kindle Edition. 
		</p>
		<p>
			As matter of fact, the truth is truth. The truth does not need any evidence. The evidence is primarily used to prove against the sins rather the truth. It is through this kind of argumentation to prove the sinful world that the truth can be shown in the world. 
		</p> 


	<h5>Conclusion</h5>
		<p>
			Biblical study is the Bible study with the enhanced academic format. Biblical study and the regular scientific study are very similar in form but different in being. Biblical study transcends scientific study. Scientific study serves for biblical study. Scientific study is widely accepted by all cultrues and religions in the world. It can be considered as the common ground for missionary to reach the lost. Also, its acquired scientific knowledge can be used as at most a secondary evidence for biblical study. The term biblical study is not found in the Scripture. There is a trend in the world that biblical study is gradually downgraded and replaced by regular scientific study. Biblical study is superior to regular scientific study but cannot replace the Bible study in fellowship group. Christians should not trust in human understings of the Bible but trust in HIM only. Christians should not be confined in the pattern of either scientific study or biblical study. The Bible does not conform any pattern of the world.

		<p>
			Anything learned in biblical study should become witness to testify "the testimony is true" (John 21:24) so that "you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life by His name." (John 20:31)
		</p>


	 






	    <h5>Biblical study and scientific study</h5>
		<p>
		</p>
		
		<p>
	
		</p>
		<p>
			Scientific study sometimes can help to better understand the Bible. For example, the history study show that Jerusalem was destroyed around 70 AD following the Jerusalem riots of 66. Howerver, the four Gospel did not mention it as if it did not happen ever. This shows that Gospels writers did not care about the historic event of the world. It is important for patrisim but not important for Christians at all. Christians only concerns about the kingdom of heaven which is closely related to both individuials and will of GOD. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Moreover, scientific study can contradict to the biblical study. For example, the miracle that turns water to wine is against scientific evidence and study. Such evidence lead scientific people do not believe in the Bible. 
		</p>

		<p>
			
		</p>
		<p>	
			In the Gospel of John, it can be found that Jesus used seven different kinds of witnesses to 'testify' who He is. Jesus also gave authority of such theological argumentation method to his disciples to testify for HIM from Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and to the end of the earth(Act 1:8) to accomplish his great commission (Mat 28:20).

		Scientific Evidence vs Biblical Testimony<br />

		<p>
			The word "testimony" appeares about 104 times in the Bible, 47 in OT, 57 in NT, 32 in the Gospels, 15 in John. The word "witness" appeares about 106 in the Bible, 62 in OT, 44 in NT, 14 in the Gospels, 4 in John. The word "testimony" was used by Jesus: Mat 5, mak 3, luk 3, John 8. John: 5:31,32,34,36, 8:14,17; 19:35; 21:24. While articulating the high chritiology, the gospel of John also emphasized the its fundimental biblical testimony method used, which is another differences from synoptics.</p>

			Science is a dehuman way to acquire knowledge. But the prototype of evangelism. 

		To ignore the science of contextualization is risky business. You may feel good that you are obedient in sharing the gosepel with a lost community but if no one understands your message, the lost remain lost. (Mission of God p421) 

	Everything including scientific evidence can be used for the biblical testimony to testify Jesus Christ. Every true Christian has his own testimony of Jesus. Every testimony must be used with others publically to testify Jesus in all nations which the Great Commission Jesus gave to us.</p>
