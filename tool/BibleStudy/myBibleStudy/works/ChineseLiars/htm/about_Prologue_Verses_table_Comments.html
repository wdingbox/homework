				<b>The Word/Logos/Dao: </b>
				<ol>
					<li>
						For Jews, it represents the supernatural&nbsp;revelation of God.</li>
					<li>
						For Greek Gentiles, it represents the reason/power/force.<br />
						<p>
							The idea of Logos goes back to the founder of science and the philosopher Heraclitus of Ephesus (sixth century B.C.). He taught that all things were in a state of flux, that nothing ever remains the same. His famous quote is &quot;No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it&#39;s not the same river and he&#39;s not the same man.&quot;&nbsp;However, order and pattern can be perceived amidst the eternal ebb and flow of things in the Logos &mdash; the eternal principle of order in the universe. It is the Logos behind everlasting change that makes the world a cosmos, and an ordered whole. Ladd, George Eldon. A Theology of the New Testament (p. 275). Eerdmans Publishing Co - A. Kindle Edition.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>
							Philo of Alexandria (20 B.C. - 40 A.D.) occupies a unique place in the history of philosophy. He was a Jewish thinker living in one of the most important cities of the ancient world during a pivotal time. Much of Philo&#39;s work is focused on the transcendence of God and the &quot;Logos.&quot; The notion of the Logos was deeply ingrained in Greek philosophy during the first century. But what makes the Philonic Logos particularly compelling is that the Gospel of John (the Evangelist) calls Jesus Christ the &quot;Logos&quot; (John 1:1-3). Questions have subsequently arisen regarding what extent, if any, Christian doctrines such as the Incarnation are derivative of Philo. The aim of this article is to provide a brief sketch of the Philonic Logos and compare it with the Johannine* Logos. A close analysis shows only surface level similarities between these two conceptions. <a href="http://www.blogos.org/churchhistory/philo-logos.php">[]</a></p>
						<p>
							Philo was committed to the Jewish faith and found no conflict harmonizing Jewish theology and Greek philosophy. Logos is the bridge between the infinite God and finite creation. God is revealed to His creation through the Logos, though not in a personal way. The Logos is the wisdom of the divine and the organizing principle of matter. The Platonic Ideas (i.e. Forms) are situated within the Logos, and the material world is formed according to these templates.</p>
						<p>
							The Philonic Logos is the highest of the intermediary beings between God and man. The Logos is the &quot;first-born&quot; of God, but inferior to God. God expresses Himself and His acts through the Logos.</p>
						<p>
							The term &quot;Logos&quot; is used a great deal in the Old Testament, although it does not have a univocal meaning. The Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Septuagint, renders Logos hundreds of times across various books.</p>
						<p>
							Whether Philo connected the Logos with the Jewish Messiah is an interesting question.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						For Chinese, Dao道 represents the mysterous ethic and supernatural invisible unutterable power. Dao is a word of combination of the first, beginning and the eternal life.
						<p>
							It has noble ideal features but cannot be defined, named or identified who he is. Dao is a one of top unresolved mysteries for more than 2500 years in Chinese culture. The question &quot;Who/what is the Dao on earth?&quot; still cann&#39;t be agreed in China today.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Although cultures, language, ethnics, geographics are different, human spiritual strugglings, perplexing迷茫 , despiration, bitterness are the same from far ancient to today. For different specific meanings from different cultures, John bring together all different understandings of what the concept of Word means to lead to one ultimate salvation. It is not John but God whose mercy to bring all nation together--it is supernatural but can be named--the Word is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only One who make God known.(John 1:18)</p>
				<p>
					This is a particular good news for those who still explores Daoism.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The beginning</b>
				<ol>
					<li>
						To know God through time and space dimensions: Beginning is the point in time or space at which something starts. 1) eternal: no start and end; I-am-who-I-am; the LORD; 2) everlasting: has a start but no end; kingdom of Heaven.</li>
					<li>
						Gen 1:1 &quot;In the beginning, God create heaven and earth.&quot; means that the heaven and earth were passively created; they have a beginning point. What about the end? The narration of Gen focuses on the beginning; but 99% of whole Bible is about the end--the fate of the world including each individual.</li>
					<li>
						The beginning is parallel to the first, Alpha. Rev 22:13 &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&quot; Alph, Omega, the first and last alphabet of Greek, the base of languages, represent the human civilization of the world. This world is not everlasting and has an end. The time has end: the end of the age. The space has end: the end of the earth. The Day of the Lord, the Day of Judgement is near. Human beings and the world have a beginning and end. It is not hard to understand because each God has give each individual a consciousness that he has a beginning and end of his age.</li>
					<li>
						Compared with Gen 1:1 with John 1:1a &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot;, it can be found that the Word is similar to &quot;heaven and earth&quot; in that both have the beginning. The difference is that &quot;heaven and earth&quot; were created by God. Whereas the Word was not created. The Word was in the beginning. Gen 1:1 focuses on doing; John 1:1a focuses on being.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<b>1:1b The Word was with God.</b></p>
		<ol>
			The preposition &quot;with&quot; implies that
			<li>
				The Word is different from God. The Word and God are two entities.</li>
			<li>
				The Word and God coexist or stay together all the times. It means that the Word is the same eternal as God, the same as I-am-who-I-am, what God claimed.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<b>1:1c The Word was God.</b></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				John 1:1c &quot;The Word was God&quot; means that the two entities, the Word and God, are one the same. The Word and God have no relationship of creation. The Word is equal to God in divinity, which means that the Word has exactly all what God has.</li>
			<li>
				Moreover, John 1:1c &quot;The Word was God&quot; is different from &quot;the Word was a god.&quot; The Word is holy unique. The Word is &quot;the One and Only&quot;. (1:14,18)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<b><a class="john">1:1</a></b></p>
		<p>
			There is a difficulty for people to fully understand the relationship between 1:1b and 1:1c. This leads to difficult to understand the relationship between the Word and God--God became the Word--the preparation for that the Word became the flesh. (1:14a)</p>
		<p>
			This issue belong to part of trinity difficulty which has been debated in the first six hundreds year of AD. It is impossible for any scholars to fully explain. The full solution has to count on the faith, which is the goal of the book of John, and also what the whole Bible what to tell, the will of God, the love of Jesus.</p>
		<p>
			The difficulty leads to the seperation of the world. One will accept it; another will refuse it. Just like the believers have overcome the issue in Gen 1:1, the children of God can overcome difficulty in John 1:1.</p>
		<p>
			In the first verses, John provides three concepts: the beginning, the Word and God, as well as the miraclous relationship among them. The role of this verse is comparable with the first verse of the Bible. There exists parallels in three concepts: the beginning, the world (heaven and earth) and God. Verse John 1:1 is a re-proclaimation of God as in Gen 1:1. The gospel of John is a new version of Genesis with differences in times and languages but completely consistent in theology--the will of God.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<b><a class="john">1:2</a> He was in the beginning with God.</b></p>
		<p>
			Mathematical approach: A=B,B=C, then A=C.</p>
		<ol>
			In 1:1,
			<li>
				In the biginning == the Word; (1:1a)</li>
			<li>
				The Word == God (1:1c)</li>
			<li>
				=&gt; In the biginning == God. ---(x1)</li>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			In 1:2,
			<li>
				He == in the beginning. (1:2a)</li>
			<li>
				In the biginning == God. (x1)</li>
			<li>
				=&gt; He == God. ---(x2)</li>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			As comparion of 1:1 and 1:2,
			<li>
				He was in the beginning.(1:2a) (In the beginning was the Word. 1:1a)</li>
			<li>
				He was with God.(1:2b) (The Word was with God. 1:1b)</li>
			<li>
				He was God.(x2) (The Word was God. 1:1c)</li>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			Conclusion from the comparison:
			<li>
				He was the Word.</li>
			<li>
				The Word was Him.</li>
			<li>
				The Word is a singular person but not named yet until 1:17. It is a part of miraclous process that the Word became flesh (1:14).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<b><a class="john">1:3</a> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. </b></p>
		<p>
			Necessary and Sufficient Condition: He is N&amp;S for all things. e.g. air is N for life. Jesus is N&amp;E for all things. Jesus is N&amp;E for each individual. All things were created by God.</p>
		<p>
			Col 1:16 For by Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities--all things were created through Him and for Him.</p>
		<p>
			In Gen 1:1, &quot;In the beginning God created heaven and earth.&quot;, all things were created by God. In 1:3, the world was made through Him.</p>
		<p>
			<b><a class="john">1:4</a> In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. </b></p>
		<p>
			it is wrong that people have life. life belong to Jesus. People do not have life at all!
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the bridge from divinities to humanities: God, the Word, life, light and mankind. a) He is the Word and God who is the eternity. b) The Word is Jesus creating the universe. c) Jesus is the life bring the light into the world. Jesus is the light.</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;In him was life [zōē], and that life [zōē] was the light of men&rdquo; (John 1:4). The double reference to zōē is not accidental. In the Creation story God breathed into Adam&rsquo;s nostrils the &ldquo;breath of life [pnoēn zōēs]&rdquo; (Gen 2:7) and Adam became a &ldquo;living creature [psuchēn zōsan].&rdquo; He did not posses life on his own accord but rather received it from God. When Eve was created Adam named her &ldquo;Eve&rdquo; (&ldquo;life,&rdquo; zōē in the LXX), because &ldquo;she was the mother of all living&rdquo; (Gen 3:20). <a href="https://spectrummagazine.org/article/kim-papaioannou/2012/01/13/john-11-13-creation-divinity-salvation">[]</a></p>
		<p>
			<b><a class="john">1:5</a> The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome(understood) it. </b></p>
		<p>
			The light means the truth. (positive)<br />
			The darkness means the ignorance, foolish. (neutral). (not false or liar, negative)</p>
		<p>
			Gen 1:2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water.</p>
		<p>
			Gen 1:4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.</p>
		<p>
			Developed from God, are 1)the Word, 2) HE, 3) the world, 4) Life, 5) Light, 6) man. They are similar to the six days of creation. The darkness is type of mankind, light, life and world. It is the beginning of the splitting: the earthly world and kingdom of heaven, the death and eternal life, the true light and liars, or the blind, the glory and darkness--the belief and disblief.</p>
		<p>
			There is Chiastic structure from 1:1 to 1:5. There are more words about being for identification, but the central point is identical in doing compared with the description of creation in Genesis.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				being (1:1)</li>
			<li>
				--being (1:2)</li>
			<li>
				----doing (1:3)</li>
			<li>
				--being (1:4)</li>
			<li>

		</ul>

			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<b><a class="john">1:6</a> There was a man sent from God whose name was John. </b></p>
		<p>
			Contrast to the Word, John Baptist can be easily named. This partialy implies that this man is not HIM, even though he was sent from God, but he was not God. Whereas the Word, He was sent by God, and He was God (1:1c)</p>
		<p>
			<b><a class="john">1:7</a> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. </b></p>
		<p>
			John Baptis was the last prophets in OT, the first initiator of the belief and disbelief.</p>
		<p>
			<b><a class="john">1:8</a> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. </b></p>
		<p>
			John 1:7 and 1:8 looks like the duplication in meaning. The negative word &quot;not&quot; (&omicron;ὐ, ou) apeeared. It seems like the God&#39;s first command for Adam.</p>
		<p>
			Gen 2:16 And the Lord God commanded the man, &ldquo;You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>
			<b><a class="john">1:9</a> The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. </b></p>
		<p>
			Jesus was born in Bethlen. God -&gt; The Word -&gt; world -&gt; Life -&gt; Light (truth) -&gt; the world.</p>
		<p>
			<b><a class="john">1:10</a> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. </b></p>

			<strong>paradox</strong>悖论 noun a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			There are two basic types of paradox: rhetorical修辞 and logical.</p>
		<p>
			The former is &quot;a figure used to shed light on a topic by challenging the reason of another and thus startling him&quot;(Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, edited by Walter A. Elwell, 826, 827; Robert L. Reymond, Preach The Word! 31, 32). The Bible dearly contains rhetorical paradox (compare Matthew 10:29; John 11:25,26;12:25; 2 Corinthians 6:9,10).</p>
		<p>
			Logical paradoxes, however, are altogether different. Here we have a situation where an assertion (or two or three assertions) is self- contradictory, or at least seems to be so. One way or the other the assertion cannot possibly be reconciled before the bar of human reason. The hypostatic union of the divine and human natures in the one person of Jesus Christ, unconditional election and the free offer of the Gospel, and God&rsquo;s sovereignty and man s responsibility, are examples set forth by the advocates of biblical (logical) paradox.</p>
		<p>
			Physics also contains paradox phenomenon. Like the light is both wave and particle.</p>
		<p>
			The triniy is a paradox for human beings. But if we look at ourselves, we lived in a self-contradict life. We cann&#39;t understand the paradox because we are in sin, the blind. We should not complain why Scripture is controdict each other. What we see the controdiction in the Bible is what sin we have in our spirit.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Dualism</strong>二元论:&nbsp;The most difficult problem in the Johannine theology is its apparently different dualism from that of the Synoptics.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The dualism in the Synoptic Gospels is primarily horizontal: a contrast between two ages &mdash; this age and the Age to Come.The Synoptic contrast this age with the Age to Come, and we know from the Pauline use that &ldquo;this world&rdquo; can be an equivalent of &ldquo;this age&rdquo; in an eschatological dualism. [Ladd p.259]</p>
		<p>
			The dualism of John is primarily vertical: a contrast between two worlds &mdash; the world above and the world below. &ldquo;You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world&rdquo; (Jn. 8:23).</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Light and darkness, Flesh and spirit,&nbsp;<br />
			<br />
			Kosmos: Humanity at Enmity with God.&nbsp;<br />
			The most interesting use of kosmos for humanity is found in the sayings where the world &mdash; humankind &mdash; is the object of God&rsquo;s love and salvation. God loves the world (3:16) and sent his Son to save the world (3:17c; 12:47).&nbsp;</p>
