				The first verse of the Gospel of John is almost always used as a starting point to prove the Trinity. However, is there another way to understand John 1.1? Was John, a first century Jew, articulating the completely non-Jewish idea that God became a human being or have we read that into John 1.1? Join Anthony Buzzard as he explains the meaning of John 1.1-14 in its original Hebrew, thought context. Jesus is a Jew, the son of carpenter. Jesus is the prediected Messiah. The first born. Many believe HIM will the second the third, and forth. --the mirror of Adam. --Noah. (they do not die for us.) --Ehiah. substution of word with Son. personified. my time.&nbsp;</li>

					However, a study of the Greek word logos shows that it occurs more than 300 times in the New Testament, and in both the NIV and the KJV it is capitalized only 7 times (and even those versions disagree on exactly when to capitalize it). John 1:1 3x 1:4 1x; When a word that occurs more than 300 times is capitalized fewer than 10 times, it is obvious that when to capitalize and when not to capitalize is a translators&rsquo; decision based on their particular understanding of Scripture. (...) One is the mind and products of the mind like &ldquo;reason,&rdquo; (thus &ldquo;logic&rdquo; is related to logos)&nbsp;</div>
				<div>
					God in the begining is personified.(create, speak, walk, love, grave, etc)&nbsp; But none eve see God. It is prediction for fresh Jesus.&nbsp; It is important to note that it was &ldquo;Christian teachers&rdquo; who attached the idea of a &ldquo;divine person&rdquo; to the word logos. (...)&nbsp; Jesus is the &ldquo;image of the invisible God&rdquo; (Col. 1:15)&nbsp;</div>

			1. synpotics look at outside--what He say and did. John look inside-who He was.
			2. God use different personality to write one union personality of God.
			3. not mention Kingdom of Heaven.
			4. 7 miracle 5 is new 2 are same. John did not call it as miracle but sign--where it point to. 
			   look through miracle.
			   one to one vs crowd. 
			5. based on outline of Mark.  30 months of north in Galilee followed by 6 months in south. 
			   John almost all in south. 
			   conflicts John concentrated on south. 

			6. John has not short parables. 

			7. John wrote in Ephesus in Turkey the mixture of Greek and Hebrew.
			   western is Greek style: vertical time. between key words: heaven and world. up and down. Up/down
			   Hebrew horizontal in time. past present future. 

			8. author. between Galilee and south.  

			   12 disciple 5 or 7 of them are relatives of Jesus.  (North) 

			   not believe until after ascesion. 
			   James and Jude 

			   three close Peter, James and John. among 3 has 1 favorite, last surving. 
			   that&#39;s why Jesus ask John to care his mother. 
			   Peter jelous to John. 

			 9. purpose of the book. 
			    go on believing. 
			    faith go on believing. 

			 10. 3 phases
			    1. believing not faith which is noun. 
			        - credence: to believe that is true  --accept 
			        - confidence: believe in that. obey and do sth to show trust.--doing 
			        - continuance: go on believing, holding the truth (faith==faithfullness), eternal. --holding. 

			        trust on someone, you will trust him whatever happened whatever cost. 
                    if you are full of faith, you are faithfull--go on believing in someone. 

                2. Truth is someone. what is truth?
                   Truth is not proposition. but a person. --great revelation of John gospel. 
                   people always think truth is something not the person. 
                   what do you think of Jesus.
                   rumors and lengends began to creep in 
                   speculation came in about Jesus. 
                   speculation(推测): the forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence.

            the magic number 7.  a perfect round number in Hebrew is always 7. 
            it is not our figuring but it was in Hebrew thinking. The most important number in the Bible. 
            anything that falls short of that is less than perfect six six six. but 777 is something. (13:41)

              	  science is small part, and become less and less. 
              	  John said you need ask the reason of whole.
                   What is the reason why it&#39;s all here.   
                   the answer is Jesus. All is made by jesus son of God. 
                   that is the reason I was here. 
                   He is the reason why, he is the logos. excepting concept.

                   1. his eternity: already there. 
                   2. his personality (face to face, personal, son and God love each other. hence God is love. single person cannot love)
                   3. his deity: was God. rather than a god.
