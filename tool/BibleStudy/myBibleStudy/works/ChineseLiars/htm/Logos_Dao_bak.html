And God’s living, instant speaking  (Rhema) always corresponds with His written Word (logos), which keeps us on the right path (way). These instant words guide us and turn us to Him when we take heed to them.

==============================================
http://shepherdproject.com/rhema-logos/

Just recently I was asked about the significance of the Greek words rhēma and logos.  Both of these terms are typically translated with the English “word”, as though they were synonyms, but some interpreters think that there is a tremendous difference between the two terms.  Among our more charistmatic Christian brothers and sisters, it is common to distinguish the two words as follows:

rhēma = spoken word, usually referring to additional revelation that extends beyond the written word of Scripture
logos = written word, usually referring to revelation as found in the Old and New Testaments
This is a very interesting and potentially significant distinction, provided that the biblical authors intended their readers to understand the words in this way.  However, close inspection of the usage of these two terms both in the Bible and in extra-biblical materials makes this distinction rather hard to maintain. Rhēma sometimes refers to written text (cf. Ex 34:1) and logos to spoken words (cf. Heb 2:2), the exact opposite of what is being claimed by some teachers today. On the whole, the two terms seem to be used interchangeably throughout Scripture.

This is not to say that there is never a meaningful distinction between the two words, however.  It is particularly interesting when certain writers shift between rhēma and logos within their writings. The author of Hebrews, for instance, uses logos most frequently (some 12 times), but does employ rhēma to a limited degree (4 times).  That author does seem to use rhēma in a way that almost associates the “word” of God with the activity of God (cf. Heb 1:3, 6:5, 11:3, 12:19) which lends some support to the charismatic distinction mentioned above.  However, two things must be noted:  first, this distinction is more pronounced in Hebrews than in most other biblical texts so that even if there is a legitimate distinction of terms here, this same distinction cannot be read into works by other authors. Second, even if the author of Hebrews did use rhēma to signify the activity of God, this divine activity is not obviously related to revelation.  If anything, the above-mentioned uses of rhēma in Hebrews signify creation (Heb 6:5), sustenance (Heb 1:3, 11:3) and, possibly, judgment (Heb 12:19), but they have no obvious relationship to God’s ongoing revelatory activities. In fact, in Hebrews it is logos which has the stronger connotation of revelation (cf. Heb 4:2, 4:12) in both its written and spoken forms.

So, even where one biblical author uses rhēma and logos in a way which may be distinct, the distinction is subtle at best.  I am not convinced that there is no meaningful distinction between the two words, but if there is one, it is not at all obvious.  In any event, the idea that every use of rhēma in the Bible refers to God’s continual revelation of Himself beyond Scripture simply cannot be supported by biblical investigation.  I’m not a cessationist, mind you.  I do believe God continues to speak to His people today (though always in ways which are consistent with the revelation given to us in the Bible), so our inability to distinguish between these words need not be taken as a denial of the claim that God still speaks.  All I’m saying is that the argument for God’s continued revelation must be made on other grounds. The distinction between rhēma and logos in Scripture is simply to hazy to make it a foundation for doctrine.

			        trust on someone, you will trust him whatever happened whatever cost. 
                    if you are full of faith, you are faithfull--go on believing in someone. 

                2. Truth is someone. what is truth?
                   Truth is not proposition. but a person. --great revelation of John gospel. 
                   people always think truth is something not the person. 
                   what do you think of Jesus.
                   rumors and lengends began to creep in 
                   speculation came in about Jesus. 
                   speculation(推测): the forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence.

Seeing God Face to Face

by Kim Riddlebarger

I suppose that if you were to ask Christians whether or not they would like to “see” God, most would say “yes.” Human curiosity often wins out over our knowledge of biblical passages such as Hebrews 12:29, which informs us that “our God is a consuming fire.” While Scripture promises that the pure in heart will see God (Matt. 5:8), Paul makes it clear that such sight cannot come until death, when believers enter God’s presence. It is God alone who “has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see” (1 Tim. 6:16). But one day — at the appearing of Jesus Christ — Paul says we will see that which our sin and finitude currently prevents us from seeing (6:14–15).

In his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul writes that the beatific vision (to see God as He is) is promised to Christians when Jesus returns at the end of the age: “For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known” (1 Cor. 13:12). In Paul’s day, a mirror was formed from polished metal, usually bronze, tin, or silver. One’s reflection in such an object was dim at best. Yet Paul promises that the dim image reflecting back from polished metal will give way to a face-to-face encounter. When Jesus comes back, we will see Him with our own eyes. On that day, our imperfect knowledge will give way to sight. We will know, even as we are fully known.

While Paul directs us ahead to that glorious day when the Lord returns, the beatific vision has its roots in the Old Testament. In Genesis 32:30, we read that Jacob saw God: “So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, ‘For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.’” Moses also saw God. According to Exodus 33:11, “Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.” The same thing is found in Deuteronomy 34:10: “And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face.”

In the Exodus 33 passage, Moses asks to see God’s glory — a request that God graciously grants. But God must protect Moses so that Israel’s leader is not consumed. As we read in verses 18–23: “Moses said, ‘Please show me your glory.’ And he said, ‘I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘The Lord.’ And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,’ he said, ‘you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.’ And the Lord said, ‘Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock, and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.’” Moses could see God’s back, but not His full glory (that is, His face).

In the New Testament, we learn that Moses and Jacob did not see God in some abstract, intangible way. As John opens his gospel, he informs us that “no one has ever seen God,” but that Jesus, “the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known” (John 1:18). This echoes Jesus’ statement in John 6:46: “Not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God [that is, Jesus]; he has seen the Father.” Since Jesus is God (the second person of the Trinity), He alone has seen the Father, meaning that Jacob and Moses saw the pre-incarnate Jesus, whose glory was still too great for sinful humans to see.

Just like Moses, one of Jesus’ disciples, Philip, desired to see God. In John 14:8–10, we read the following exchange between Jesus and His curious, but clueless, disciple: “Philip said to him, ‘Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?’” Since Philip had seen Jesus, Philip had already seen God. Jesus’ divine glory was veiled with human flesh. It is likely that Philip wished he could recall his question just as soon as he asked it.

But the hope remains for the people of God (those reckoned righteous through faith in Jesus) who have been rendered holy and pure of heart. For us the promise remains: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Matt. 5:8). This promise will be fulfilled on that day when Jesus Christ returns. What is now quite dim will become crystal clear. Faith will become sight.




However, a study of the Greek word logos shows that it occurs more than 300 times in the New Testament, and in both the NIV and the KJV it is capitalized only 7 times (and even those versions disagree on exactly when to capitalize it). When a word that occurs more than 300 times is capitalized fewer than 10 times, it is obvious that when to capitalize and when not to capitalize is a translators’ decision based on their particular understanding of Scripture. (...) One is the mind and products of the mind like “reason,” (thus “logic” is related to logos) 
God in the begining is personified.(create, speak, walk, love, grave, etc)  But none eve see God. It is prediction for fresh Jesus.  It is important to note that it was “Christian teachers” who attached the idea of a “divine person” to the word logos. (...)  Jesus is the “image of the invisible God” (Col. 1:15) 


While we do not agree with the Catechism that the only meaning of beginning in John 1:1 is the beginning of the new creation, we certainly see how the word beginning is a double entendre. In the context of the new creation, then, “the Word” is the plan or purpose according to which God is restoring His creation.
