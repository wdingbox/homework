<b>
	three themes in John
	1) Jesus: Man and God
	2) development of belief.
	3) development of disbelief.

	Three Parts in the Outline
	1) Prologue 1:1-1:18
	2) Proof through His Administry 1:19-12:20
	   reaction of belief and disbelief.
	3) Proof of Death and Resurrection. 
	   13:1-21:25
	   reaction of belief and disbelief.




	The Word/Logos/Dao:
	1) for Jews, it represent the revelation of God.
	2) For Greek Gentiles, it represent the reason/power/force.
	3) For Chinese, it represent the mysterous ethic and supernatural invisible unutterable power. It has features but cannot be defined or named. 

	For different specific meanings from different cultures, John bring together their understandings of what the concept of Word means--it is supernatural but can be named--He is Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 


	In the beginning: 
	1) eternal: no start and end; I-am-who-I-am; the LORD;
	2) everlasting: has a start but no end; kingdom of Heaven. 


	3) Gen 1:1 &quot;In the beginning, God create heaven and earth. &quot;
    heaven and earth were created, have a beginning. what about the end?
	
	5) the beginning also represents Alpha.
	Rev 22:13 &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&quot;
	Alph, Omega, the first and last alphabet of Greek, the base of languages, represent the human civilization of the world. This world is not everlasting and has an end. The time has end: the end of the age. The space has end: the end of the earth. The Day of the Lord, the Day of Judgement is near. Human beings and the world have a beginning and end. It is not hard to understand because each God has give each individual a consciousness that he has a beginning and end of his age.
	


	Compared with Gen 1:1 with John 1:1a &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot;, it can be found that the Word is similar to &quot;heaven and earth&quot; in that both have the beginning. The difference is that &quot;heaven and earth&quot; were created by God. Whereas the Word was not created. The Word was in the beginning. 

	John 1:1b &quot;The Word was with God&quot;, the preposition &quot;with&quot; implies that 1) The Word is different from God. The Word and God are two entities. 2) &quot;with&quot; means that the Word eternally coexists with God. It means that the Word is the same eternal as God, the same as I-am-who-I-am, what God claimed. 

	John 1:1c &quot;The Word was God&quot; means that the two entities, the Word and God, are one the same. The Word and God have no relationship of creation. The Word is equal to God in divinity, which means that the Word has exactly all what God has.

	Moreover, John 1:1c &quot;The Word was God&quot; is different from &quot;the Word was a god.&quot; The Word is holy unique. The Word is &quot;the One and Only&quot;. (1:14,18)  


	Mathmatical approach: a=b, b=c, then a=c.
	1) a) In the biginning == the Word; (1:1a)
	   b) The Word == God (1:1c)
	   c) =&gt; In the biginning == God.

	2) He == in the beginning.
	   In the biginning == God.
	   He == God.

	3) necessary and efficent condition.
	   He is N&amp;E for all things. 

	   e.g. air is N for life.
	   Jesus is N&amp;E for all things.
	   Jesus is N&amp;E for each individual. 

	   All things were created by God. 

	   Col 1:16 For by Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities--all things were created through Him and for Him. 

	4) bridge from divinities to humanities.
	   a) God is the Word eternity.
	   b) The Word is Jesus creating the universe.
	   c) Jesus is the life bring the light into the world. 

	   Jesus is the light. 
	    

	5) The light means the truth. (positive)
	   The darkness means the ignorance, foolish. (neutral).
	   (not false or liar, negative)
	   Gen 1:2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water. 

	   Jesus is the truth but the world refuse Him.


	6) John Baptist.
