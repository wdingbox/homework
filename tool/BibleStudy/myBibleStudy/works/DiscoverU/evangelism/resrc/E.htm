    Invitational Evangelistic Style
</h3>

Description & Summary
<br><br>
(1) I enjoy adding or including new people in activities I am involved in. (2) To be honest, I often watch for
situations in which someone "better qualified' can explain concepts to my friends. (3) It is not unusual for me to
attend special events or concerts and bring along a car full of friends. (4) I tend to watch for worthwhile events to
which to bring people, such as enriching seminars, retreats, classes, or church services. (5) I am always looking for a
good match between the needs and interests of my friends and various books, classes, and programs that they would enjoy
or benefit from. (6) A highlight of my week is when I can take a guest along with me to a helpful learning event,
including church.

Is this a good description of who and what you are? Then it is probably safe to state that you are very likely part of
the group possessing the Invitational Style. This is very similar to the previous style, as it is most definitely
people-oriented, however the emphasis is somewhat more upon those with whom you don't yet have a close, intimate
relationship than with those you do. It is focusing upon bringing new people into your circle of intimacy. Those who
possess this style are hospitable, inviting, persuasive, enthusiastic. They have what some have termed a "bubbly"
personality. They almost always seem to be "up," and people enjoy being around them; indeed, they seem to be
irresistibly drawn to them.

The Samaritan woman whom Jesus encountered at Jacob's well just outside of the village of Sychar (John 4) is given as a
good example of this style. Although Jews did not normally relate well to Samaritans [vs. 9], and it was not considered
fitting for a woman to converse with a man in an unsupervised setting [vs. 27], yet these two struck up a rather
intimate conversation. When she realized that the One to whom she was speaking was someone quite special, she "went back
into the village and said to the people, 'Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?'
So they came out of the town and made their way toward Him" [vs. 28-30]. Later we are informed, "Many of the Samaritans
from that town believed in Him because of the woman's testimony" [vs. 39]. We may not all be equipped to "close the
deal" evangelistically, but most can at least invite others to "Come, and see!" Andrew did this for Peter [John
1:41-42], and so did Philip for Nathanael [John 1:46] and then later for the inquiring Greeks [John 12:20-22].

        5. Cautions:
        <ol type='a'>
            <li>
                Do not let others do all the talking for you. Your friends and acquaintances need to hear how Christ
                has influenced your own life. In addition, your friends have questions you could answer concerning the
                implications of the Gospel in their own lives.
            </li>

            <li>
                Carefully and prayerfully consider which events or church services you take people to. Look for ones
                that are
                truly sensitive to spiritual seekers that will help them in their journey toward Christ.
            </li>

            <li>
                Do not get discouraged if people refuse your invitation. Their refusal could be an opportunity for a
                spiritual conversation. Also, their “no” today may be a “yes” tomorrow.

        <ol type='a'>
            <li>
                When inviting people,try to get written detail sabout the event into their hands (either preprinted or
                hand written
                out). Whenever appropriate, offer to pick them up and do something together before or after the event.
            </li>

            <li>
                At events, put yourself in the place of the other person. Ask yourself if you were that person,
                whether the event would relate to your concerns and mindset. Reinforce those things to the person you
                invited.
            </li>

            <li>
                Offer positive and constructive feedback to the event sponsors consisting of specific and realistic
                ideas on ways you think they could improve the event and make it more compelling to people you bring.
            </li>

            <li>
                Team up with friends who have other styles that may be better matched to the personality of the person
                you hope to
                reach.
