<h3>
    Serving Evangelistic Style
</h3>
Description:
<br>
<br>This is most likely your dominant style if the following statements best describe you: (1) I see needs in people's
lives that others often overlook. (2) I find fulfillment in helping others, often in behind-the-scenes ways. (3) I would
rather show love through actions than through words. (4) I have found that my quiet demonstrations of love and care
sometimes help people open up and become more receptive to what I think. (5) I think the world would be a better place
if people would talk less and take more action on behalf of their friends and neighbors. (6) I tend to be more practical
and action-oriented than philosophical and idea-oriented.
<br><br>
If you have responded, "That's me!" to these six statements, then you are representative of the Serving Style. Such
people have a tendency to be others-centered, patient, willing to work behind the scenes, and typically demonstrate love
through their actions, rather than through mere words alone. Again, it is hard to find many negatives with respect to
people who simply want to love one another, and who seek to do so in a quiet, unassuming manner.

The biblical example given by Hybels, Mittelberg and Strobel is that of Tabitha (Dorcas) in Acts 9:36-42. This
woman lived in Joppa, and "was always doing good and helping the poor." One of her talents was making clothing for the
poor, a gift for which she was well-beloved in that area. Following her death there was much grieving among the widows,
to whom she had apparently been a great blessing. The apostle Peter was summoned and he raised her from the dead. "This
became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord." Not only the miracle of her restoration to life, but
the grace of her service while living, had touched many people's lives. Tabitha was truly the embodiment of the Serving
Style of evangelism, and she was most effective in her ministry. Not all evangelism has to be showy or dramatic.
Sometimes just simple acts of loving charity will do more to reach the lost than just about anything else. After all, as
the saying goes, "people don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care!" Tabitha cared -- so she
served -- and she won souls to Christ Jesus.

        Cautions:

            <li>
                Remember that although “words are no substitute for actions,” “actions are no
                substitute for words.” In Romans 10:14, Paul says that we must verbally tell people
                about Christ. You can do this in many ways as you point to Him as the central
                motivation for your acts of service.
            </li>
            <li> Do not underestimate the value of your service. It is your style that will teach those
                persons who are the most negative and hardened towards God. Acts of loving
                service are hard to resist and difficult to argue with.
            </li>
            <li> Be discerning as to how much you can do realistically, without depriving yourself or
                your family of needed care and attention.

        Suggestions for Development:
        <ol type='a'>
            <li>
                Find creative, non-imposing ways to communicate the spiritual motivation behind the
                physical acts of service you offer to others. It could be that a word, a card, an
                invitation in response to thanks for your service. For example, you might send a
                follow up message that reads, “Well, one thing you could do for me would be to come
                with me to one of our worship services at church.”
            </li>
            <li>
                Seek God daily for opportunities to serve others for eternal purposes. He will open
                your eyes to areas you would have missed. Be ready to follow His leadings, even if
                they seem a bit out of the ordinary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be careful not to impose your service on others. Pray for wisdom so you will know
                where to invest your efforts in ways that will be strategic for the Kingdom of God.
