    Intellectual Evangelistic Style
</h3>
Description & Summary
<br><br>
This is most likely your style if the following statements describe you: (1) I have a hard time getting out of a
bookstore without buying a bunch of new books that will help me to better understand what people are thinking. (2) I
tend to be analytical and logical. (3) In conversations, I naturally key in on questions that are holding up a person's
understanding or progress. (4) I really enjoy discussions and debates on difficult questions. (5) Often, when listening
to teachers or TV commentators, I mentally (or even verbally) argue with their positions and logic. (6) I like to get at
the deeper reasons for opinions that people hold.
<br><br>
If you respond, "That's me!" to these six statements, then you are representative of the Intellectual Style. Such men
and women have a rather strong tendency to be inquisitive, analytical, logical, and far more focused on what people are
thinking than how they are feeling. Negatively, those within this category are often perceived as cold, aloof,
insensitive, impersonal and uncaring. It is not so much that they don't actually experience these various emotions, it
is just that they have become adept at suppressing them or relegating them to lesser importance, placing more value upon
the intellect than the emotions. Such a focus can most assuredly prove to be a major hindrance to evangelistic efforts
among a certain class of people, though, in all fairness, it must be acknowledged that there are indeed those who
appreciate a more analytical, logical approach to the study and presentation of the inspired Scriptures, with fewer
displays of raw emotionalism (what might be termed as "touchy feely"). People are different, that is a fact, which is
exactly why the Lord has created diversity even among His servants, so that there is someone for every kind of seeker.
<br><br>
Not everyone is moved by an appeal to the emotions; indeed, some find it almost offensive, and will virtually flee from
such encounters. They will, however, sit for hours upon end and engage in a reasoned dialogue with another on the
theological intricacies of God's Holy Word. These seekers also are precious in the sight of God, and He desires them to
be brought to Jesus as well. It will take a special kind of evangelistic style to reach them, however -- the
Intellectual Style. Hybels, Mittelberg and Strobel cite the example of the apostle Paul in Acts 17:16ff as being
representative of this particular style. While in the city of Athens, Greece, Paul "was reasoning in the synagogue with
the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the market place every day with those who happened to be present" [vs.
17]. He engaged the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers in the Areopagus, and even at times quoted from their own poets and
revered writers. Paul knew how to stand toe-to-toe with the best philosophers of his day, and he could hold his own with
them; indeed, he even won some to Christ. Not just anyone could have reached these people; it required a certain
evangelistic style. The same is no less true today. There is, without argument, a place for reasoned, reflective,
analytical, logical dialogue in evangelism. Some, quite literally, will never be reached without it. Thus, God equips
some disciples with this personality trait, and then opens doors of opportunity for them to witness to those precious
souls in need of enlightenment and liberation.

                Avoid doing all your preparation in an academic vacuum. Get out and talk to other people about their

            </li>

            <li>
                Develop your relational side. Talk to people about everyday events, and what is happening in their life
                and yours.
            </li>

            <li>
