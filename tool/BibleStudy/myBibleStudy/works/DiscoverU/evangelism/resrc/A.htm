<h3>

    Direct Evangelistic Style
</h3>
Description & Summary
<br><br>
If you identified to a large degree with the following six statements, you would most likely fall into this category:
(1) In conversations, I like to approach topics directly without "beating around the bush." (2) I don't shy away from
challenging someone when it seems necessary. (3) I do not have a problem confronting my friends with the truth even if
it strains the relationship. (4) I think the world would be a lot better place if people would stop being so sensitive
about everything and just speak the truth! (5) A motto that would fit me perfectly is: "Make a difference or a mess, but
do something." (6) I sometimes get in trouble for lacking gentleness and sensitivity in the way I interact with others.
<br><br>
Does all of this sound like you? Can you relate? Then you very likely are the embodiment of the Direct Style. Such
persons, from a positive perspective, are quite confident, bold, assertive and to-the-point. They have a tendency to be
rather confrontational in their approach to people and situations (which can be either positive or negative depending on
attitude and motivation). On the negative side, such persons tend to be somewhat "in your face" with regard to matters
about which they feel strongly. They are right, you are wrong, and they are there to confront you and convert you ...
whether you like it or not. This would be the preferred style of most disciples who consider themselves to be militant
in their efforts to "contend for the faith." The downside of such is that this too frequently devolves into being
contentious for the faith, which only serves to drive people farther away from Truth. If you've ever had someone knock
on your door, only to be asked, when you opened the door to them, "If you died today, would you go to heaven or to
hell?",
<br><br>
you have encountered those who have adopted the Direct Style of evangelism. Frankly, this turns many people off,
although, it can be effective when used with love and sensitivity to the Spirit.
<br><br>
On a more positive note, there are indeed times when it is counterproductive to "beat around the bush" with certain
persons and situations. Some who don’t yet know Christ don't need subtlety; it flows off them like water off a duck.
They need the proverbial 2x4 right between the eyes in order to "get their attention." Those disciples equipped with
this evangelistic style are divinely equipped to reach such persons, as long as they employ healthy doses of wisdom and
discretion and love in their confrontation of those in need of turning their lives around. Hybels, Mittelberg and
Strobel cite the example of the apostle Peter in Acts 2 as being representative of this style. In his sermon on the day
of Pentecost, Peter didn't beat around the bush; he got right to the point.
<br><br>
He was direct, blunt and in your face! He told the Jews assembled that day that they had murdered their Messiah, and if
they wanted to avoid the wrath of God they had better repent. Three thousand responded. Yes, under the right
circumstances, and if employed responsibly, this can be a most effective approach.

        Suggestions for Development:

        <ol type='a'>
            <li>
                Ask friends for feedback on whether or not you have the right balance of boldness and gentleness.
            </li>

            <li>
                Prepare for times of standing alone for the gospel, and know that others may feel uncomfortable when
                you confront others with the truth (in love). That’s okay. Be confident, under God’s guidance, to
                challenge people to trust and follow Christ, and He will use it.
            </li>

            <li>
                Be sure to listen and value what others say before telling them what you think they need to hear.
            </li>

            <li>
                Team up with friends who have other styles that may be better matched to the personality of the
                person you hope to reach.
            </li>
