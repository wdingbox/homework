<h3>

    Testimonial Evangelistic Style
</h3>
Description
<br><br>
Are the following six statements descriptive of you? (1) I often speak out of my personal background or experience in
order to illustrate a point that I am trying to make. (2) I often identify with others by using phrases like, "I used to
think that too" or "I once felt the way you do." (3) When I talk around the locker room or the drinking fountain, people
really listen. (4) I intentionally share my mistakes and struggles with others when it might assist them in considering
solutions that could help them. (5) People seem interested in hearing stories about things that have happened in my
life. (6) I am still amazed at how God has worked in my life, and I would like others to know about it.

If, after hearing these characterizations, you exclaim, "That's me!", then you most likely are the embodiment of the
Testimonial Style. Those men and women within this category have a tendency to be good listeners, clear communicators,
and rather compelling storytellers. They have the ability to hold the interest of those with whom they seek to
communicate, whether those people necessarily agree with what they're hearing or not. From a negative perspective, such
persons may be characterized by some as "theologically shallow" -- "He tells a good story, but there is no depth." For
example, some have this impression of author Max Lucado. He is a master storyteller, yet there are some who feel it is
all "fluff" and no "substance." The simple reality, however, is that many seekers are moved by such dynamic narrative.
For them, such a style is exactly what is needed to bring them into a relationship with Christ Jesus. Again, people are
different, so the Lord has raised up servants with differing evangelistic styles so that all may be reached.
<br><br>
The blind man in John 9 is given as an example of this particular style. One day Jesus and His disciples came upon a man
blind from birth. "And His disciples asked Him, saying, 'Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be
born blind?'" [vs. 2]. An interesting question! Jesus doesn't even waste His time debunking it, but merely declares that
what is about to occur is to the glory of God. Jesus healed him, and, needless to say, news of the miracle spread
rapidly. This man was brought before the religious leaders and they questioned him repeatedly. He stuck to his story,
however, and gave testimonial to the divine healing power of this Jesus. The leaders did not like what they were
hearing, but he definitely had their attention. His testimony was riveting. And yet, at the end of the day he was cast
from the synagogue, "for the Jews had already agreed, that if anyone should confess Him to be the Messiah, he should be
put out of the synagogue" [vs. 22]. Yes, the Lord Jesus needs people with a compelling story to tell in a creative way.
Personal testimonies clearly have a place in evangelism, and they can be used to touch the hearts of many seekers, as
people can easily relate to them.

        <ol type='a'>
            <li>
                Be sure to relate your experience to the life of your listener. This requires first hearing enough
                about your friend’s life to know how to relate your story to their situation.

            </li>

            <li>
                Do not stop with merely telling your story. Challenge them to consider how what you learned might
                apply to their life.


            </li>

            <li>
                Avoid downplaying the value of your story because it seems too ordinary. The ordinary story is the
                kind that relates best to ordinary people.
