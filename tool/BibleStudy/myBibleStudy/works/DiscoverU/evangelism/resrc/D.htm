<h3>

    Interpersonal Evangelistic Style
</h3>
Description: 
<br><br>
How do you personally relate to the following? --- (1) I am a "people person" who places a high value on friendship. (2) People have commented about my ability for developing deep friendships. (3) I would rather delve into personal life issues than abstract theoretical ideas. (4) I prefer discussing a person's life before getting into the details of their beliefs and opinions. (5) I enjoy long talks with friends, and it doesn't matter much where we are or where we're going. (6) People generally consider me to be an interactive, sensitive and caring kind of person.

Does this all sound like you? If so, then you are the embodiment of the Interpersonal Style. You have a tendency to be warm, compassionate, conversational, friendship-oriented, and focused upon people and their needs. Frankly, it is hard to see too many significant negatives associated with being a good friend to others and seeking to be involved in their lives, with the possible exception that some might perceive your interest and concern as meddling. Many are proponents of what is known as "Friendship Evangelism," which simply suggests that a very effective way to share one's faith with others is to do so from a foundation of a growing interpersonal relationship.

Hybels, Mittelberg and Strobel cite the example of the apostle Matthew (Levi) in Luke 5:29 as being a fitting representative of this particular style. After having been called to leave his tax booth and follow Jesus (at which time "he got up and left everything and followed Him"), "Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them." This devoted follower wanted to share his newfound faith in the Messiah with as many people as he possibly could, so he hosted a large party for the Lord at his home, inviting all his friends and loved ones to come. Friendship evangelism is the methodology of those with the Interpersonal Style. When they find something wonderful, they immediately want to share it with all those with whom they have a close relationship.

         Blind Spot: Sometimes, you put the friendship over the gospel, instead of the gospel over the friendship. As a result, you never get around to sharing the gospel because you’re afraid to damage the friendship, when in reality, the friendship is not really at risk much at all.

         Cautions:
        <ol type='a'>
            <li>
                 Beware of valuing friendship over truth. Telling them they are sinners in need of a savior will test the relationship.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                 Do not get so involved in the process of building friendship that you forget the ultimate goal: bringing people to know Christ as forgiver and leader.

                 Do not get overwhelmed with the amount of needs your friends might have – do what you can and leave the rest to God.
